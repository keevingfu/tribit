US,B07594HZ6Y,R3LG8MXKJVFN5X,Sad really sad I am about through with Tribit,Color: Black,"Got the speakers a d found out they had a stereo mode if you connected two. Bought a second one and tried. It initially worked, and loved tbe results so much bought a second Storm.
<br>
<br>A voila it stopper working in stereo mode. Like their apps, just gets Bluetooth confused and will not enter into stereo mode, after resetting the speakers and doing a full ininstall and reinstall.
<br>
<br>As mentioned in a previous review -their programmers are useless when it comes to Bluetooth and cannot competently utilize the features regardless of platform. For me, has failed on both iOS and Windows 11 systems. Don't ask for technical assistance, to get any you have to submit more psperwork than the US government requires for taxes.
<br>
<br>I do like the sound tbeir products generate, but cannot deal with the constant and daily Bluetooth hickups trying to get them to work. Again no help from corporate. You should not have to do this much troubleshooting to get their products to work day-to-day.
<br>
<br>In the market for good sound and a reliable speaker system that works on all or any platform: Windows, iOS, or Android. Tribit is not it. I am ooking for recommendations. Returns are in my plans for what I can send back.",是,1,Robert A. Johnson,2025-02-20
US,B07594HZ6Y,RXUIF61POHO3L,Nice little speaker!,Color: Black,"The only gripe I have is the lack of higher tones/treble. It is surprisingly good with the bass notes for its size and the volume is very nice/loud. The battery life seems to be very good, after watching two movies the battery is at 70%, not bad at all. For the price this speaker would be tough to beat. Over all I am happy with the Tribit speaker an it's built like a little tank. The C-port charging is another plus an it sounds WAY better then my JBL GO 3, but then again its bigger with two tinny speakers.",是,5,Mother of 1,2025-02-19
US,B07594HZ6Y,RJ5OQ1ZURXGN2,Easy to connect and great volume and sound,Color: Black,"Bought this to replace spaghetti of wiring to get remote sound for den TV. Family said I had volume too high at night. This little Bluetooth speaker was super easy to connect to TV. Bass is great as well as highs. Love to be able to move speaker around as I work on different projects. Having volume control built-in eliminates having to carry remote also. Battery lasts several hours, longer than I am away from desk. Great performance.",是,5,JHPArizona,2025-02-18
US,B07594HZ6Y,R1QOQVE3VR366R,Beware: Fails After a Couple Years,Color: Black,"I've had three of these speakers. They all failed in different ways after 2-3 years of very occasional use, all indoors.

US,B07594HZ6Y,R1Z1NBJGASQQO4,Decent but not great,Color: Black,tried the speaker for about 1 hour. Decent but not great. Heavy on that treble side and bass is not as deep as it could be. Give it a solid 3 out of 5 stars. Volume level good. It's on par with the oonz original speaker. Not bad for a $30 speaker but pass if you're looking for bass that bumps.,是,3,Frank MTB,2025-02-15

US,B07594HZ6Y,R1X0YN8P6MYJ1Q,Surprisingly good sound quality and construction.,Color: Black,I bought the Tribit XSound as a speaker to connect via cable to a Raspberry Pi 4 project.

US,B07594HZ6Y,R3U8FLS3HXXEO6,"Clear, crisp, High Fidelity sound, although not a lot of bass",Color: Black,"These little guys sound fantastic. They don't quite have the bass punch that other speakers have, but it's still pretty good. But what sold me on these speakers was there overall mid-range clarity and the high frequency response. I also bought the bigger brother of these, which sacrificed the high end and mid-range to punch up the bass. This sounded so much better than the big brother, so I returned it and kept these. I can highly recommend this little speaker.",是,5,P. McK,2025-02-06

From the moment I connected it to my phone and started playing music on the YouTube app, I bwas BLOWN AWAY. This little thing packs a surprisingly hard punch and the music comes out so crisp and clear. I am very impressed with the performance and I haven't even broken it in yet. Highly recommended!",是,5,Mork,2025-02-01
US,B07594HZ6Y,R1PGDQTB612ZNO,"Sound is flat, poor, disappointing.",Color: Black,"I am so disappointed with the sound of this speaker. I bought it to replace the JBL Flip 3 I had and loved for many years - it had great sound but stopped working. From the strong reviews for this Tribit XSound Go plus the low price, I thought it would be a no-brainer great choice for a Bluethooth speaker. That was a mistake and I regret the purchase. I'm going to sell or give away the Tribit XSound Go - that's how mach I hate the flat, tinny sound it has - and buy another JBL Flip instead.",否,2,guytac,2025-02-01

US,B07594HZ6Y,RLBUP88ZZ6WB3,Good While it Lasted,Color: Black,"well, had it for about a year and a half now. Worked great at first. really good sound. Easy to connect. don't use it THAT often - hooked up to my phone initially, then the desktop to listen to music in the living room. About 6 months ago, started having connectivity problems (that's been fun) and now it won't play anything without the sound cutting in and out. different speakers work great. Does the same thing regardless of whether I'm connecting to music on the computer or listening to something streaming. Disappointed for the price. Should have much better durability. I'm having better luck and sound with an older speaker that was half the price.",是,2,phoebec61,2025-01-30

This wonderful speaker solved that problem. I can even hear them with the water running when I'm working in my kitchen. Now I'm looking forward to borrowing the audiobooks I couldn't hear before, and I don't have to waste time playing a sample on every one. The volume on this speaker is amazing. Thanks, Tribit! Don't hesitate, just buy it. Great for senior citizens. You won't be disappointed.",是,5,M. Johnson,2025-01-27

The instructions are a little confusing - lots of different languages to sort through, and it doesn't show you how to charge it; but its easy to figure out. Comes with a cord, but not a charging plug, so make sure you have a spare to plug in the USB. It does hold the charge for a long time.

US,B0CXPQVMP6,RPHYTDYHEE9B7,If you have a Samsung watch it will close the watch sound to go very low,,"I've never had a speaker for my cell phone before. I decided to buy this from Amazon. I installed it on my Samsung 24 ultra phone which is new. I bought it in June of this year and also bought my Samsung 6 watch at the same time. I connected it to the Bluetooth and the sound was fair. But I noticed when a phone call came in it came through the speaker. I went into the settings and had the speaker just be audio only and removed calls. Later that day I turned off the speaker and A call came in on my phone. I normally answer my calls on my watch because it's easier than running to find the phone all the time. If it's going to be a longer call I'll tell them to hold on and then pick up my phone and transfer the call to the phone. A bit later that day my phone rang and I noticed my watch ringtone was extremely low. I went ahead and answered the call anyway I could hardly hear the person on the end of the line and they couldn't hear me barely. I completely uninstalled the speaker, removed all Bluetooth and Wi-Fi settings in my phone. Reset my network I did so much it took days. I factory reset my watch for different times still couldn't get anything to work. I talked to Samsung for hours for almost 3 days. I called T-Mobile they were great and they helped me work with it but again couldn't get it to work. The speaker now is 100% disconnected from my phone and watch. My watch is still not working correctly. Has anybody else had this kind of problem. I'm going to take it to T-Mobile tomorrow and see if my watch will connect to one of their phones at T-Mobile and see what the sound is like then. If the sound is good then I'm going to have to factory reset my phone what a pain in the butt. I will give you some updates later in the week.",否,1,C S,2024-11-25

US,B0CXPQVMP6,RDKSA3R4KQ6SQ,Best of 3 tested,,"I was looking for a small Bluetooth speaker for my garage when I work on my pro street cars and I wanted a small speaker that I could take to Cruz nights. Not a boom box for $300 dollars.
<br>I bought 3 different speakers after too much time researching around $70.00 that were supposed to have a “Great Bass” sound. Best of the 3. Return other 2 for free within 30 days.
<br>The first one arrived in a small hard case and inside was a speaker about the size of an egg. It’s good for a bathroom or office desk. It was about half the volume of the other two and average bass. 3rd place.
<br>The second one wasn’t a brick. Good sounding speaker overall. Lacks a little in bass, but a really good sounding speaker for the money.
<br>I went with this speaker because you can increase the bass after you get their free app. Best bass of the 3 tested. You can change the equalizer to several different sound options on the app and you can really hear the difference. It sounds great in the garage and I was surprised how far the sound travels outdoors at the Cruz nights. For its size and cost I think it really sounds good even at full volume. Doesn’t distort. Haven’t timed how long it lasts at full volume, but it’s got to be around 8 hours or more?
<br>I bought a total of three of them for my garage since you can pair them and they sound awesome even at 1/2 volume.
<br>I got them on sale for $29.99ea On Amazon. I’m very satisfied with them and I think you will be too. I hope you enjoy them as much as I do.",是,5,John L,2024-11-12

<br>I was serious enough long ago to have a CBS Labs vinyl test record (separate L and R tones from 20Hz to 20,000Hz) to calibrate my stereo system. But now, due to age, my hearing is diminished in range. Even though I can't hear the entire range, I can tell that the signal to noise ration is very high, the timber very good, the bass is deep and clear, the treble is clean and clear, with no distortion on either end.
<br>
<br>If I could rate it 4.75 stars, I would. 5 stars for the sound, 4.5 for the lack of a volume control independent of the input level. The ability to remember and automatically pair to two sources (phone and tablet) is super convenient. The bluetooth connection distance is more than I need.

The speaker sound quality is great and it actually gets pretty loud. Issues abound, tho: The charging cord is so short that I have to plug it in behind a plant on the floor for it to actually reach the outlet while it's playing, which means I'm constantly having to belly crawl under the plant to use the buttons. Why so short???? Is cord that expensive to manufacture? Yes, I know I can buy a new cord, but why. Also, the buttons are not that responsive, so I have to press REALLY hard, and then it has a habit of turning on then off again with one push. Annoying. If I don't play music for a few minutes, it turns off automatically, so I have to belly crawl back there to turn it back on. And finally, lots of static interference.

I give them 5 stars not because they are the best little Bluetooth speakers around, but because they deliver pleasing sound and features at a really good price point, and were trouble-free to set up. I have the two speakers in stereo mode, meaning both speakers (on either side of the bed) play from a single source (an Echo Dot), and it sounds good! Setting up the Bluetooth connection and stereo mode was easy by following the included directions. These speakers are not going to blow you away, but they will produce a very pleasing sound.

When I plugged it in with a small/cheap C charging cord, it kept repeating “Battery low,” and did not charge (I waited for like 10 mins to see if it just needed to get some juice, all while listening to it repeat the above!). I contacted customer service and they offered me a discount on a new speaker right away. I experimented a bit, found a heavier C cord, and plugged it in. The red light came on and it began charging and charged to 100%!! The speaker is now functioning well!
<br>In the meantime, the Tribit customer service reached out again to see how they might help and were willing to stand by their product and send me a new one.

If you are using it for music, podcasts, etc. during the day, it's an awesome speaker and I highly recommend it!!! My only complaint is that I wish the volume was independent from the phone. What I mean by that is if I adjust the volume on the speaker, it turns down the phone and vis versa. In order to get the speaker soft enough, my phone has to be practically to zero and it's still too loud on the speaker.

<br>16 watts for about 30 bucks and some change, much better than any knockoff junk for around the same price. The bass is clear and pronounced, but doesn't drown out any other aspects of a mix. Maybe sometimes the highs can really be a little shrill, but some albums I listen to are sort of mixed that way so can't really say the speaker itself is faulty or cheap. The overall sound is incredibly clear, definitely loud enough for a bedroom, personal use, backup speaker for your car.
<br>Highly recommend. I've also had the anker soundcore 8 or 6 watts speaker, and for about the same price you get a louder, clearer, and better mixed sound (30 bucks). Thinking about getting the 30 watts speaker, this speaker being this good being the reason why.",是,5,Mark,2024-09-06

It has a nice low end sound and very crisp highs when you are near it but loses its punch from across the room. Its really small so that's to be expected.

It projects nicely, and sounds very full for such a small speaker. The lows aren't going to blow you away, but, come on -- it's tiny. The overall frequency balance and utility of it more than make up for the lack of bass. It's the right size, too -- just small enough for walking/skating/biking without being too heavy or cumbersome, but big enough to still be audible and sound good while moving around.

I'm no audiophile, but the sound is plenty good enough--a whole lot more pleasant than listening to music, radio, tv or audiobooks directly from the iPhone or Amazon Echo Dot. The Bluetooth syncs easily and is more convenient to pair and reconnect than a lot of the other BT devices I have used over the years. The battery lasts a good long while, warns you ""battery low"" several minutes before dying, and is easy to charge via USB-C. Physically, the speaker is compact, sturdy and easy to carry around. Of particular note: One of these goes into our small bathroom shower with me every time I shower and gets a pretty good soaking--has done ever since it was new. Again, 2.5 years of that, and never a hiccup, still going strong. I just ordered a third Tribit speaker, to keep in our camper.",是,5,mtn_lion,2024-05-03

<br>The sound quality is decent, the battery lasts a long time, and the bass is punchy.
<br>
<br>My only gripe is that it's rounded so I can't set it up vertically and when it's on a smooth suface since it vibrates cause of the sound it will move and fall off where placed.

The main frustration I have with the speaker is that the volume cannot be consistently controlled from the device, only from the speaker. It works sometimes... and then others not. Doesn't seem to be any rhyme or reason to it. When it happens, sometimes I can fix it by forgetting the device and re-pairing. Sometimes that doesn't work. So I can't figure out why it stops working or how to reliably fix it. None of the other speakers or devices I have, have this problem.

US,B07594HZ6Y,R1ZP6LY9ASIUHH,Hourglass sound (nothing in the middle),Color:Black,"SUMMARY:
<br>An underwhelming, directional speaker that's harsh on the ears. Waaaaaaaayyy over-rated.
<br>
<br>PROS:
<br>Size, weight, price.
<br>Not too many annoying button/power/pairing feedback sounds.
<br>When in stereo mode, controlling one unit controls the other (volume and power)
<br>
<br>CONS:
<br>Very minimal bass
<br>Practically zero midrange
<br>Excessively harsh, tinny treble
<br>Instruction manual not great.
<br>Shape only allows one orientation (can't side stand or place on back)
<br>
<br>DETAILS:
<br>Got these because I wanted stereo pairing in portable speakers- but was sorely disappointed. Not sure how many AI bots they employ to create +32K ultra positive ratings - but they've done their job, and I was duped. Returning both immediately.",是,3,Mr.J,2024-03-03

But I've owned it for the last three years and use it almost daily. I work on a job site where we have people coming and going daily. Different vendors and different people work for different lengths of time. This Tribit speaker ended up in the lost and found. It sat there for the duration of the project, about 3 months. At the end of the project, no one claimed it...so I borrowed it for a weekend getaway, and it has stayed in my possession since. I keep this on my desktop and it acts as my computer speaker for my MacBook Air when it is docked. I bring this on trips out of town and use it for music in the hotel room, or at the beach.

US,B07594HZ6Y,R7L2BOMK522TT,These MAY have unseated the Tribit XSound Surf as ny FAVORITE sounding bluetooth speaker,Color:Black,"To be fair I was going to wait to write this review. The thinking was something really impresses me at first when it’s right out of the box, but then becomes “meh… I like it but it’s just ok” after some time using it. Before I begin, I will not bore people with the list of bluetooth devices I have but just to note, I do have some Tribit headphones, as well as the following bluetooth speakers
<br>
<br>- Oontz Angle 3 Ultra (that matters … I think as you go up in the Oontz lineup they sound a bit better than the last)
<br>- 2 Tribit XSound Surfs
<br>- LFS – LFS 180 – my first BT speaker
<br>- Braven BRV-1
<br>and a DOSS Soundbox Touch
<br>
<br>I DO WANT to note that this review is on the apparent Upgraded version of the XSound Surf. I think it was youtuber Oluv Gadgets that said the originals didn’t sound as good to him but then he tried the upgraded model and it sounded a bit better. Which model one gets maybe key here
<br>
<br>I am NOT a fan of “OMG this is the best … there is nothing wrong with this product” reviews but .. to be honest other than a “things to note” item or two maybe … I have NOTHING bad to say about this speaker.
<br>
<br>Sound Quality, Build Quality, just … everything I can think of, I love. Basically one of my favorite speakers has been the Tribit XSound Surf (this speaker’s “little brother” I suppose). If someone said “OK you love the XSound Surf but be critical … what would you like to make it better?” … I would say
<br>
<br>A) longer battery life .. the Surf is ADVERTISED at 10HR max (the sound quality you get makes that totally acceptable to me… the Surf sounds GREAT) … AND B) without harming the great sound … maybe a little more soundstage or a “wider” sound. … WELL … that is what I am hearing with the GO. I DO ADMIT I have had this for less than a week so I really cant comment on the battery life other than “IT DOES last longer than the Surf” … just to be fair. But somehow they made a great sounding speaker sound better.
<br>
<br>Sound is right where I like it … there is so much punch in the bass, but it’s a CLEAN bass .. it doesn’t bleed into anything in my view. Also while you may not expect it looking at the “small package” of this speaker, to get a “sub-woofer” like sound out of it, but you do. Everything is right where I like it. It’s a “U” or “V” shaped sound but its sounds good and not forced in my view.
<br>
<br>“Things to Note”: Here I have to watch how I say this … this maybe as close to what some consider a “con” as you will get but I cant bring myself to say these are Cons.
<br>
<br>- While … almost all the speakers I have are like this and I do know “360 sound” speakers exist (Tribit even has some I believe) … the sound is not as “perfect” if you are not right in front of the speaker. Meaning behind it or on the side, you may really get the great sound but it’s not the best sound compared to “head one, speaker facing you”. Again this is NOT just an issue with the XSound GO.
<br>
<br>- Late at night I like listening Smooth Jazz, and relaxing music at lower volumes. With the Go and it’s lowest setting it is quiet (what I want) but sometimes the thump of that “subwoofer” type sound is still there … it drowns out the rest of the audio. One “click” up in volume and the issue is almost solved completely. While this sounds like a “Con”… this type of tuning makes me ALSO LOVE the speaker.
<br>
<br>BASICALLY what I mean is that at specific times in my use-case … It’s not the best at it’s lowest volume and that boomy sub-woofer like sound on those genres … OTHER TIMES this exact tuning at any other time of day (even the same genres) MAKES THIS MY FAVORITE sounding speaker.
<br>
<br>Comparisons to other speakers
<br>- The LFS 180 speaker has the issue of even at it’s lowest volume AND EVERYTIME you turn it on, it’s REALLY LOUD, but worse … it has a “Bluetooth buzz or hum” to it. It has great sound, but those issues make me not want to use it as much as I normally would. The Go is better than this speaker… the LFS sounds great but those two issues hold it back.
<br>
<br>- Tribit XSound Surf – Like I said this speaker maybe the “Little brother” of the XSound Surf. Everything is basically the same but I feel the GO (again this is the Upgraded “GO”) sounds a little more “full” and open to me. The battery life at least being advertised as a bit more than the Surf is a plus too. Not counting wanting more battery life, I think that the Surf MAY have been my former #1 favorite just on sound alone.
<br>
<br>- Oontz Angle 3 Ultra – without going into too much of a description the Ultra (2nd gen I think I have) sounds decent but it can sound boomy at times. Remember when I said this GO has “clean bass” well … I don’t want to go overboard as headphone, speaker, earbud wise I have heard FAR WORSE … the bass on the ultra bleeds into the mids sometimes … DON'T GET ME WRONG, I still REALLY love and recommend the ultra, but it doesn’t sound as “crisp” in the mids and highs as it could and … really how this XSound Go sounds. I know “muddy” and while I may have just described it, the Ultra is “not that “ bad but it is noticeable to me. I just want to be fair (pro and con sound wise) to Oontz there. Also I can not speak for “lower” Oontz models.
<br>
<br>- DOSS Soundbox Touch
<br>While the Soundbox Touch has bass, don’t get me wrong and late at night at low volumes it DOESN’T have that extra thump the XSound Go has (solving one of my “things to note” issues) … at higher volumes you 100% here the bass but many would consider the Soundbox Touch lacking in the bass.. especially self described “bass heads” … I suppose it depends on the sound you are looking for, but the Go 100% HAS a thump in the bass, the Soundbox doesn’t.
<br>
<br>- The Braven I have issues the comparison at the time of me typing this. The Braven has a good balance sound (I’d say cleaner and better than the Oontz Angle 3 Ultra) but its maybe a similar sound to the XSound GO here or XSound Surf with the bass pulled back a little … a thump but not as impactful as the Go’s or Surf’s .. TOTALLY not saying that is a bad thing either way.
<br>
<br>Conclusion:
<br>This … this Tribit XSound Surf MAY HAVE de-throned the Tribit XSound Surf as my #1 favorite bluetooth speaker that I own. I DO WANT to just bring up that while I have had issues with that LFS speaker I have. I RECOMMEND ALL of the ones mentioned here… Even with some having different pros and cons.
<br>
<br>XSound Go (Upgraded) wise … well that is a no-brainer if its my new favorite. OF COURSE I recommend it",是,5,Xmetal,2024-02-08

The basic thing I plan to use it for is to listen to books I've checked out on the Libby app. I also enjoy listening to VoicePlay on YouTube and decided I'd try that too. I was surprised how well this little speaker handled all their voices. I listened to ""Hoist the Colours"" on my Bose headphones and then on this speaker. It doesn't do as well as the headphones, but considering the price differential it is impressive. This speaker is a little bass forward. VoicePlay's bass has a 5 octave range and his voice comes across louder when he's in his lower registers; this doesn't happen on my headphones. Their vocal percussionist (beatboxer) is also more prominent on this speaker as compared to my headphones. I'm sure the guy that does their audio mixing would be stressed - for me, it's fine for casual listening.",是,5,KCLady,2024-01-17

US,B07594HZ6Y,R3VVWL758LY3AF,Really love this speaker!,Color:Black,"Music generally sounds pretty good on an iPod or iPad--as long as you're listening through earbuds. Just playing it from the speakers is generally not a great musical experience. Knowing I would be spending a lot of time in my kitchen while baking goodies for Christmas, I decided to check out Amazon to see if I could find a small speaker to use with my iPod. I looked at two speakers--this one, and the OontZ Angle 3 Bluetooth Speaker. Both get high ratings, both had similar prices (on sale at the time) and I liked that the OontZ came in various colors. I spent several hours going back and forth, looking at features, reading a lot of reviews, and checking out the User Manuals for each that Amazon had posted. One thing I noticed was that the OontZ manual was significantly more detailed than the Tribit, and, not being very technologically savvy, that swayed me at first toward the OontZ. Before placing my order though, I went to the internet the next morning and typed in ""comparison of OontZ Angle 3 and Tribit Bluetooth Speakers."" One review I found helped me finally decide which speaker to order. Someone gave his opinion about each, then actually played snippets of the same song on each of the speakers, demonstrating the sound on 3 (if I remember correctly) different sound levels. Though both speakers sounded pretty good, I could tell a slight difference between the Tribit and OontZ; the sound on the Tribit was a little fuller, with slightly more bass. I placed my order and received it later that same day. I had no problem linking the Tribit to my iPod via Bluetooth (the iPod recognized it immediately) and was soon listening to Christmas music as I baked cookies that evening. The only thing that would have made it better would be if it had come with a 3.5 mm AUX Cable so I could connect my iPod directly to the speaker, but I don't know that any speakers include that. Not a big deal...I can always see if Amazon has one and if not, I can still connect via Bluetooth. I didn't rate battery life because I don't know for sure how long it is before the battery has to be charged. The speaker worked out of the box, but I didn't know if it was fully or partially charged, so after using it that first evening for several hours, I plugged it in to charge. I've had it a week now; have used it 3-4 hours for several days during the week and haven't had to charge it again yet, so my guess is that battery life is pretty good. Overall, I'm very pleased with the Tribit and would heartily recommend it.",是,5,Vottofan,2024-01-04

We used them in stereo mode when doing work together. They sound great for the $18 that we spent at the time. They are waterproof as advertised. The battery life is pretty good when brand new even at continuously loud volumes (and these do get really loud for 5w). One speaker crapped out 18 months after we bought it. It would not charge and also would not play even when plugged into a power outlet. I thought maybe it was a fluke, but sure enough another two or so months went by and the second crapped out too. Same exact way - won't even play when plugged in. It's too bad because these were nice little speakers that we used all the time. I even used them connected to my computer as auxiliary speakers and they worked great.

<br>
<br>I'm not an audiophile so I can only make comments like ""uhh... sounds good with movies"". Other people have made more in-depth comments about the audio quality so I'll refer you to them. I like it for an everyday speaker in my home office. I connect it to one of a few PCs depending on what I'm doing.
<br>
<br>The ""on"" light is blue and the recharging light is red. You can use it while recharging and the indicator lights are offset from each other so you can see both when it's plugged in and recharging while using it.
<br>
<br>I agree with another reviewer's comment about the lack of lighted buttons. It would make it a bit easier. But, the raise (""+"") and lower (""-"") sound buttons are raised and can easily be felt so it doesn't bother me much.
<br>
<br>I did have a 6-yr-old Lenovo All-in-One running Windows 10 crash twice while connecting the speaker to it while also using a Bluetooth mouse.

<br>-The speaker will disconnect and power off if sound is not going through it. Pause music or movie, come back 20 minutes later, and the speaker has turned OFF.
<br>-The connect and disconnect sounds are weird. They aren't typical rising or lowering notes that most other speakers use. I am not sure if I am turning it on or off sometimes. The disconnect sound it just strange.
<br>-The rounded back design means it can easily flip over on it's top, facing backwards, if you bump it.
<br>
<br>Pros:
<br>+Sound is OK, similar to an older rectangular Anker speaker
<br>+Battery life is OK, and USB C charging is a plus, compared to older Anker speaker's microUSB port.
<br>+It has a 3.5mm jack if you have a male to male cable to plug into something that has a headphone jack
<br>+It turns on with a quick push of the power button, very handy since it shuts off when not used for a little while.

All I want is for the unit to work. I was impressed with its quality but after having spent a half hour trying to get a replacement or even a new charging cord, without having to provide someone at a call center with my credit card, I gave up. I also went through Amazon's chat function - the call back number indicated that a phone call was available, but when selecting that option, it did not work. Instead, the chat options sent me a replacement link returning me to try to troubleshoot again, which I'd done, and not to replace the item. I'm totally frustrated. I spent a ridiculous amount of time to reach an Amazon representative. After speaking to two different people, one finally, reluctantly agreed to replace the unit after insisting I pay I restocking fee for a unit that did not work. I wasted so much time on this.

<br>This was my first purchase ever of a Bluetooth item. never had a reason to buy one.
<br>
<br>I have a subscription to Sirius XM radio and I like listening to music. It's getting warmer here in the Northeast and I tried using the app on my phone for Sirius radio and the music sounded tinny.
<br>
<br>I did some research, saw this Tribit speaker on special, and I purchased it.
<br>
<br>Wow....am I glad I did, not only was the pairing of my phone to the Bluetooth speaker super easy, I really got excited when the music started playing through the speaker....OMG!!!
<br>No tinny sound, just wonderful sounding music.
<br>
<br>Go ahead and pick the speaker up while the music is playing and the thing vibrates in your hand the speakers are booming so much, and that's not at full volume either!!!!
<br>
<br>The only thing I can't score on is the battery life, I've used it for 3 days with about 3 hours each day and it's still going strong. I haven't had to charge it yet.

Bass is sufficient, voices are clear, and the range of volume works in this setting (small bedroom). Pairing the Bluetooth was seamless, and it stays connected as long as there is sound coming to it. Which brings up the only real irritation. If you end a video but are occupied for more than a few minutes, it will shut off and for you to go back to the speaker to turn it back on manually.
<br>
<br>I wish these portable speaker manufacturers would figure out a way to either let the use set a timeout value or at the very least maintain a low-wattage Bluetooth connection to detect new sounds after timeout and automatically turn back on.

First of all, I declined Amazon’s suggested upgrade to a newer model, not because of the higher price but instead because of the size. The newer model is about 33% larger, and in my application, compact size is important. If you’re familiar with golf, the speaker is slightly larger than a sleeve of 3 balls. But it’s not flimsy. The speaker is rock solid with a comfortable heft. As for performance, wow! The Bluetooth connection is virtually instantaneous. The sound is rich and full with plenty of volume (I use it in my bedroom). And don’t sleep on battery life. I’ve used it 3 - 5 hours daily since I received it, and it didn’t need recharging until today.

The reason I dinged a star was because the port where you plug in to charge is already not the most snug and it will get sloppy over time. That is the reason I had to replace my ANKAR because the charging port was so loose, unless I held it and pushed it sideways the entire time it was charging to get a connection inside the port, it would not charge. I can see that happening to this one soon. They need a more sturdy shape, instead of the thin little plug that goes into the charging port. It's great if they are shock proof, water proof and all that jazz, but it means nothing if it fails to charge in a couple of months.

I was skeptical because this speaker was under $30, and took a chance. I'm thrilled that I did. Of course you're not gonna get the high level booming base that you would get on a fancy high level expensive speaker. But I have to say that it's much better than previous Bluetooth speakers that I have had. There is some bass there and the sound quality is excellent for the price. The pairing was easy. I also find that the controls are easy and very straightforward. It also doesn't really seem to take that long to charge. I wouldn't know about durability as I've only had it for about 3 weeks, but so far no issues. Also unsure about waterproof as I have not gotten it wet. I do like the rubbery coating, because I'm certain that wherever I feel like its not going to slide off a table if it gwts bumped. For my purposes which is just use around the house and/or yard it's been perfect.
<br>Con- The only con is that I would say that it may have a somewhat limited range and power to the connection. When I go to the room on the other side of the bathroom from my kitchen, it will start to break up a little bit. It does come right back as soon as I come back over, but I feel like it should probably stretch farther than that. (Maybe the plumping and such in that wall is an issue)",是,5,Çlmc,2023-02-12

US,B07594HZ6Y,R3QWY6QLROFFZL,Great value for music speaker; but frequency equalization would improve it,Color:Black,"This is the third small bluetooth speaker I have tried in a short period of time. The first paired well but no audio. The second lost its pairing each time it was powered off. This one pairs (a little finicky/tricky to do so) and then the pairing information is retained when it is powered down and then powered up again. It is much heavier than I expected for a small unit, possibly because of the very effective bass boost. My use is as a TV speaker near me when others are asleep, so I mute my soundbar and just use this speaker. Unfortunately it seems to be designed to play music (loudly) with great bass and I'm sure it excels at that. But to hear speech more clearly, treble boost is needed for my hearing -and there is no way to adjust the equalization. So I recommend it for music, but if you require good treble to understand speech, this otherwise very good speaker is probably not for you. Note that many of the reviews are critical of the power connection, but this 'upgraded' version (never described) has replaced that problematic connector with a standard USB C port.",是,4,BioProf,2023-01-25

US,B07594HZ6Y,R3FORLD923SM0G,"Great value for money- NO BIG BASS as others have indicated, but clean studio-like sound clarity",Color:Black,"The speaker is crystal clear! Clean and great for your phone, plus handy and not too huge to travel with. The clarity is almost like studio speakers. But I was expecting some dep base just by reading the comments so I went for it. I have an Altec Lansing IMW578 which i picked up for the same price and was quite impressed. Not this level of clarity, but a bit more bass which is what I am looking for. So the sound quality is awesome, bluetooth is a cinch. Now if you hold the speaker in your hand turned up toward your face, you can get some better base. I think where most of us fall is the expectation built up by the other comments. So what I would suggest, is to expect a clean, I can't say enough the clarity is sweet, but seems like the base sounds to ""to me"" like out of phase speakers. Now all that said, it will now be left to your ears. I don't understand those who are used to listening to Bose say this thing has base? But anyways, if you set your expectations up like you are expecting the base from a sub-woofer attached to your computer, then no! So I din't give 5 stars because my expectations were not met. The speakers sounds good though. If they had one with a little bit more base to beat my Altec Lansing Lifejacket, I would return it. But I will keep. If my Sanyo 58"" TV sounded this great, I would be happier. But this will be likely connect to the TV. So sorry for the second edit, but I had to come back and say the sound is amazing!

US,B07594HZ6Y,R1X49P47JOUE6U,"Clear sound & good volume with just enough ""thump"".",Color:Black,"This is a great speaker! The volume output is really good for indoors, it's room filling sound that I can still hear pretty good in adjacent rooms also. The clarity of the music is more important to me these days than just having super loud or mega bass capabilities, and the clarity on this is what most impresses me. But don't get me wrong, this also gets pretty loud and still puts out some nice smooth, non distorted bass as well. Even at highest volume. Secondly, I am amazed at how long the battery life lasts. I can go numerous outings with this thing with enough juice to keep going, even when using at high volume for hours!
<br>
<br>For outdoors I use this a lot while traveling on my bike. It's a bit less impactful this way, as the bass levels feels a little lost in the open air environment and sometimes if I'm moving too fast or in proximity to noisy traffic, I'm unable to hear the tunes as clearly with the volume all the way up.
<br>
<br>But all in all for the cost and the quality you're getting, I'd say it's one of the best speakers value- wise, that I've ever owned.
<br>So good in fact, that I recently ordered a second one. And despite the new one being the upgraded model with more wattage along with my original being the ""old"" model. I was still able to successfully pair them together for stereo sound. (Note: that you basically get stereo quality sound with just one speaker as it is, but with two it's more of a surround type of stereo sound.) This creates a much better listening experience.

US,B07594HZ6Y,R1YP4JA0VEQUM2,Great little sturdy speaker with outstanding sound,Color:Black,"This speaker has been around for awhile but must have had some updates since it comes with a usb c. I purchased along with the tribit maxsound plus in Oct 2022. I purchased as a travel speaker while doing locums work as a physician. I typically listen to audiobooks and jazz music. It has great clear, crisp sounding audio and surprisingly full sound. It doesn't seem to need a case so can easily be thrown in my carrying case. Simple, easy controls, lasts 24 hours! I compared with the max sound plus. Although sound is not as full, the clarity is as good, and, although the max sound plus is small, this is significantly smaller. I liked that the max sound plus had an audiobook feature, but found the sound not as clear as either its own unenhanced mode or the xsound go's basic sound. The unenhanced sound on the max sound plus, however, did sound a little more full but clarity of sound in both was outstanding and the fullness of sound in the x sound go was more surprising given its diminutive size.

US,B07594HZ6Y,R1E83ZWNQ2TLT8,"Have speaker, will travel: Great little speaker for the price",Color:Black,"I’ve got an old GoGroove SonaWave speaker purchased in 2012 which has served me well through the years and still works. It’s not a Bluetooth, though, and I couldn’t use it with my new phone. I also needed more volume in certain settings. After borrowing friends’ Bose SoundLink mini-speakers for use in VBS music, I decided to invest in a mini-speaker of my own, looking for a less expensive alternative to Bose. After comparing specs and experiences, I settled on this Tribit XSound Go.
<br>
<br>This speaker has been taken to the pool, beach, accompanied me on various car and plane trips, served in VBS music, blasts tracks when I’m working out at home – and it delivers. I switch back and forth easily from my iPhone to MacBook with Bluetooth connectivity. I’ve never had to re-pair after the initial setting, and all I have to do is disconnect from one device and reconnect with the other. Yet I can still use the aux-jack with my old non-Bluetooth laptop which I still use for music editing.
<br>
<br>I’m very much pleased with the volume and the sound quality. In leading VBS music in a choir room over the years, I found no significant difference between the previously borrowed Bose mini-speakers and the Tribit XSound Go. Neither are going to shake the walls in a larger room. In a smaller room like the spare bedroom where I do my workouts, the sound fills the room and I don’t need full volume to do it. The Housemate Husband is often closing the door so he can watch TV down the hall in peace. The bass notes come through fine, and I like a good bass when I’m working out. Again, it’s not going to shake the walls, but it’s more than adequate at less than full volume and covers up my enthusiastic whoops and hollers.
<br>
<br>Range for connectivity is good as well, discovered accidentally when trying to play something from my phone or laptop in the kitchen and hearing the sound emanate from the workout room. That’s a distance of 37 feet plus going around a corner another 6-8 feet.
<br>
<br>Some folks have faulted the speaker that there’s no forward-back button on the controls. Check the instructions: pressing play twice skips a track, pressing it three times repeats…. It works! As it is, I’m more likely to use the phone or laptop controls to skip or repeat.
<br>
<br>Time between charges is more than adequate. I’ve never really kept track of how long a charge lasts, but in taking the speaker to the pool several days a week and using it 2-3 hours at a time I may need to charge it once a week. The light by the power button will start flashing red slowly when it’s getting close to needing a recharge (those instructions again!); by the time the speaker tells you “Battery low” and the red light is flashing faster, there’s not much of a charge left and it’ll shut off within a few minutes.
<br>
<br>Overall, no drawbacks, only positives in over 9 months of regular use, and I can recommend this speaker for home and travel.",是,5,altokat,2022-10-04

Thought it would turn off with no signal but that is not the case when the 3.5mm jack is used. Searched and found many want to turn off this function. Just slide a 3.5mm plug into the input - the bluetooth still works and mine never turned off until the battery died. Besides all that it is an awesome speaker for the price!

It definitely serves my needs excellently. I have been using it most days since I bought several months ago and I’ve only charged it a couple of times. Battery life is above and beyond. I go weeks without charging. Bluetooth connectivity is very quick and easy, however, the range is not fantastic and if there are things between the phone and speaker, it can get static-y. For example, if my phone is in my back pocket and I’m facing the speaker from a couple yards away, the sound will start breaking up.

One can pair the speakers to have L and R channels. This is easy by simply holding down on the bluetooth symbol on each speaker simultaneously - the voice says ""stereo mode - right channel/left channel."" Sometimes it does pop out of stereo mode and you must re-pair them which can be annoying. And be sure to use your phone's ""EQ"" settings to play around with sound - sometimes these speakers can sound muffled or with too much bass/low-end when.

US,B07594HZ6Y,R2JWKGPOKZSUQW,Great Value,Color:Black,"I bought this after the battery in our Bose Mini 2 died and I saw that replacing the battery in that was going to be a major operation. I have over 40 years of experience as an electronics tech along with engineering experience. I won't spend another $200-250 for one of those speakers because of that obvious design flaw.
<br>
<br>Fast forward. I went on to Amazon and looked at what the alternatives are and found that there have been quite a few added over the past few years. I went through the reviews and decided to buy one of these Tribit sets. It sounds ""almost"" as good as the $200 Bose for about 30% of the money. You do give up a few things when going to these less-expensive speakers but the tradeoffs weren't severe.
<br>
<br>First, the bass response of the Tribit isn't quite as tight as the Bose, but it's fine for background music (and hey -- this is what we use these speakers for, right?). The Bluetooth won't remember two sources, so you will need to push the button if you want to use your phone, for example, when your spouse's phone was the last connected device. To us and our priorities, both of the slight shortcomings were not deal-breakers.
<br>
<br>The speaker has different musical note sequences for power on/off and connecting via Bluetooth.
<br>
<br>The battery seems to be holding up. Today is day 2 of playing it on its first charge and it's still going. The speaker comes with a cable but not a charging source. Again, we have drawers full of charging cubes, plus the old charger from the Bose speaker. Like all Li batteries, it is best to charge it up and then let it run down before recharging, rather than keeping the battery topped-up.
<br>
<br>All-in-all, it's a user-friendly Bluetooth speaker that's great for playing music from a phone, laptop or what have you. Does the $200 speaker sound better? Yeah, a bit. The price of this speaker was less than a replacement battery for the $200 speaker.",是,4,NC Steve,2022-07-09

US,B07594HZ6Y,RMV0QSSGB7GX2,"Not Much Louder, If at All Than 6W BT Speaker",Color:Black,"6-9-22
<br>I'm reviewing the Tribit XSound Go Model TS-BTS20 16W (2 eight Watt speakers). I literally just ordered this 2 days ago, because I was looking for something BlueTooth and more powerful than my Anker 6W speaker. I have fans running in my home, so to more easily listen to shows on my Phone or PC, I pair the sound to the speaker. I don't want to blow the speakers on my devices I regularly use.
<br>
<br>However, I was disappointed by the output of this allegedly higher output speaker. It's not at all louder and sounds about the same even at full volume. I can't attest to the battery life since all I did was connect it to power to instantly see the difference in speaker output. Accordingly, I did not rate via the specific star rating available for Battery Life. I do like the shape and feel of the speaker. This one also includes a lanyard for easier portability, which the Anker version does not. This speaker is easily connected to any device, whether a phone or PC as long as they're BlueTooth ready.
<br>
<br>One thing that does bother me on both speakers, is that they do not have a skip or repeat button. It's all incorporated into the Play button. There's an ability to skip or backup if the play button is tapped multiple times according to instructions (twice to skip, thrice to repeat or previous track), but I think it's cumbersome. In many cases, I leave my phone on charge and bring the speaker closer to where I'm working. I find that these reach about 15 feet easily if there's no interferences. So skipping a song or video is a bit of a pain. I also repeat my favorite jams from time to time, so the lack of the ""back"" button is also an annoyance but not as great. I find those features don't work as smoothly as they could as if they had their own buttons instead.
<br>
<br>Pros:
<br>1. Louder than my phone or PC, saves on the speakers of my PC or Phone
<br>2. Battery is incorporated and rechargeable
<br>3. Lanyard makes it more easily portable
<br>4. High rate of waterproofness, take it anywhere just about
<br>5. Large buttons clearly marked or ""felt""
<br>
<br>Cons:
<br>1. No independent skip or repeat button included, but incorporated into the Play button
<br>2. No visible battery level (except blinking light when less than 15% or faster blink less than 2%)
<br>
<br>I bought this from the seller ""Tribit Direct"" but fulfilled by Amazon, which I feel is important to list this info.

Unfortunately now it will not take a charge (red charge light just flashrs) and the port seems to be loose/broken. I tried to contact Tribit product support but keep receiving a message that the site “Does not exist”!! Very disappointed in this as I have recommended this speaker to family and friends.,否,1,Wayne M.,2022-04-24
US,B07594HZ6Y,R2TAYECJ4873JK,Decent speaker but annoying firmware bug,Color:Black,"The speaker sounds good and pairs easily but has an annoying firmware bug that showed itself when the device is fully discharged. When you plug it in to recharge, as soon as it hits a minimum voltage it produces an audible message 'battery low'. This message repeats constantly with no way to disable it (that I could find).
<br>
<br>The solution was to place the speaker in another room and let it charge where I couldn't hear it.
<br>
<br>It doesn't appear to be possible to update the firmware on the speaker, so the problem is probably permanent.

It turns on, it holds a charge (I've had it for several months, use pretty regularly and have charged it 2-3 times in that timeframe), and it connects to my phone and computer to play music. I don't love that it shuts off automatically after not being used (probably why the battery lasts so long) and connecting to it is slightly tricky but not horrible. It doesn't get super loud but I don't really need it to. For reference I can hear it plainly from a room or two away, not sure how much louder you want it but my boyfriend complains about it. I put it on a shelf while I shower and it works great for that.

At higher volumes, you can actually ""feel"" the bass somewhat, but it is never boomy, murky or muddy. Volume/Loudness is substantial, if needed. For example, I have a large, carpeted living room that this Tribit speaker fills with sound; and while I have never had the courage to find out how loud it actually can get, it can get quite loud with little (if any) noticeable distortion.
<br>Portability: Though not recommended, this unit fits in a front pocket of my pants and jeans, so take it camping, to the beach, anywhere, easily. There is no remote, but I control the volume at the bluetooth source, or sometimes just place it within easy reach.
<br>Battery Life: I use it some most days (use time varies), for weeks without a recharge. I never worry about the battery running low. The led changes colors to show the battery status (the battery has never run out on me yet). The charger cable is short, but it uses the common USB Micro B fitting to charge, very common and multiples are had in most households..

US,B07594HZ6Y,R1NCBJZ05QHSG8,Not going to be my beach speaker,Color:Black,"I compared Tribit XSound Go ($30) vs Tribit MaxSound Plus ($50) vs Eduplink M6 ($30). All 3 had a deal, both Tribits had a coupon and the M6 was on a lightning deal.
<br>
<br>MaxSound Plus is far superior to the XSound Go, now the MaxSound Plus is almost twice the price. But it feels only slightly heavier than the Go, and only slightly larger. If you need the speaker to be smaller I'd recommend looking into the very small options out there. The bass boost and audiobook options on the MaxSound Plus make the sound quality shine compared to the XSound Go.
<br>
<br>Eduplink M6 is a 360° speaker so comparing to Tribits Stormbox ($100+) would be better but the M6 is priced around XSound Go. The sound isn't as clear as the Tribit MaxSound Plus. The bass also doesn't compare to MaxSound Plus which has bass boost capabilities. The M6 is far lighter than either of the Tribit speakers by far. It feels half the weight of the MaxSound. But it is slightly bigger than the MaxSound.
<br>
<br>-XSound Go is the smallest of these 3 speakers.
<br>-MaxSound Plus is the loudest
<br>-MaxSound Plus has the most clarity
<br>-M6 will float
<br>-M6 is 360° so it sounds the same on every side
<br>-M6 has RGB lighting effects ""party lights""
<br>-M6 arrived with a cosmetic defect
<br>-All 3 have a cover for the charge port, USB-C
<br>-Tribit cover is easier to open, better design
<br>-All 3 have auxiliary port
<br>-All 3 say 20+ hours of battery life. It took me 3 days to drain the MaxSound Plus.
<br>
<br>I'm leaning towards keeping the Eduplink M6 because I need a beach speaker. The XSound Go doesn't stand a chance in this race. The real comparison is between M6 and MaxSound Plus.
<br>Both are plenty loud enough, MaxSound Plus has better clarity and much better bass. The M6 feels half the weight, the woven material on the M6 and silicone ends make me think it will do better keeping the sand out. The front of the MaxSound Plus has holes and if the speaker is knocked in the sand I fear it may get sand on the drivers. The M6 was almost half the price. The M6 feels like you could throw it and withstand damage better, pure speculation.",是,3,Non Paid Reviewer,2022-03-27

I was very surprised the first time I used it. It is smaller than I expected yet sounds much bigger than it is. It has a little weight to it that makes it feel well made and substantial. It seems that having the relatively large passive radiator on the front between the speakers is a great way to enhance the lower end. Just as any speaker this size, it will not rattle the windows obviously. It does fill myfitness room with more than enough quality sound. Battery life has also been impressive. I use it about 2 hours per week. I have only charged it twice since Christmas 2021.",是,5,J. Walker,2022-03-26

US,B07594HZ6Y,R2SBP7YU5K7ZK6,Not actually waterproof,Color:Black,"I really wanted to love this speaker. I had the newer generation for literally years and took it on all of my adventures around the world with me. Just the right size, sound, and battery life.
<br>
<br>My earlier generation was in my bag that fell into a hot spring in Costa Rica and was submerged for only a quick instant… and immediately shorted out and stopped working. I wrote it off as the age of the speaker and the hot water being the issues, although I was disappointed because I presumed it to be waterproof.
<br>
<br>This new one I bought a few months ago, brought to Belize, and had it in my hand as I fell into a jungle stream. Once again, it was submerged in a few inches of water for just a split second… and it shorted out and completely stopped working.
<br>
<br>As far as I’m concerned, that means these are NOT WATERPROOF. Which is a shame, because as I said, I really wanted to like this little adventure speaker and hate having to look for a new one.",是,1,John,2022-03-25

US,B07594HZ6Y,R1WFQY5OZI0R6H,The drivers on this device: Fail A lot,Color:Black,"Pro Review Time.
<br>
<br>1: Pros
<br>- this device does stand up to Portland, Oregon, N.H.N type Rain, we took it there to test it.
<br>- the sound is great
<br>- it withstood a standard photographer's drop test
<br>- it's Disability budget friendly
<br>- its fast to connect and rarely drops blue tooth connection ( when in the right range of the pared device)
<br>- Little to no annoying sound feedback (call it sound buzz for those with sensitive hearing)
<br>- it withstood the bathroom speaker-test:
<br>There was little to no sound wave distortion.
<br>
<br>2:Cons
<br>-The firmware and software drivers fail a lot when connected to a tv, or windows computer
<br>- There is no website publicly available to update the firmware or manually install drivers.
<br>You have to contact the manufacturer - This makes it a 1 off-product and huge con.
<br>- Its range is actually very short if you are not in an open space with low Bluetooth activity
<br>the device has to be within 3 feet of the paired device.
<br>-In the bathroom, the test was 10 feet away from the music test device.
<br>it did connection buffer twice making the sound go really low.
<br>when connected to a PC it lost the connection entirely.
<br>it will literally buffer connect if you are in say a concrete building with many apartments and
<br>active blu tooth devices
<br>- it is most definitely not submersible like the pictures show.
<br>- you have to gorilla glue a handle to it to hang it
<br>The area for the dedicated handle causes connection issues if the speaker isn't sitting level.
<br>
<br>A few of these cons are clearly manufacturer spec errors.
<br>We will most def get this speaker again,
<br>But with the 2 major cons - the new cool person model is not worth spending $70 + USD On",是,3,S.Shadow's Natural Photography,2022-03-16

I have an old Ultimate Ears Boom 2 that's been working great for years, but I leave that in my Sprinter van &amp; am too lazy to bring it in. I wanted something small to take around the yard &amp; have tried many different ones, each getting better as time went by. The sound and quality improved from different manufacturers. I found a great deal on this X Sound Go &amp; was curious to try it. Immediately in hand, it was a lot heavier than anything I've tried in the sub $45 range. A lot heftier. The sound matched the added heft. Better across all boards, especially bass. Not too boomy but just right. My college age son got a hold of it, he loved it so much that it's now at school with him.

Why purchase another one, one may inquire? Well, My toddler prefers to listen to Baby Shark while he is playing and I would prefer to listen to my podcast while completing household chores that require me to be constantly moving around in my home, A second Tribit was necessary for the peace and happiness of our home.
<br>
<br>Within a few days, I had Blue tooth connective issues and could not move the speaker a few feet from the phone/computer without interruption of sound. I would disconnect/reconnect but no avail. I was confused because the old Tribit still works perfectly and once paired can be taken anywhere in our home with no issue.
<br>
<br>To the well rested individual who doesn't have Baby Shark going off constantly in the background, it would have been obviously clear to completely remove the bluetooth speaker from my device and redo the pairing process. But I was not that individual.
<br>
<br>I reached out to Tribit Customer service convinced I had received a defective item. Their team responded promptly with a thorough list of trouble shooting tips. On the top of their list was the obvious solution of repairing the bluetooth speaker.
<br>
<br>It immediately solved the problem.
<br>
<br>I am now able to connect my speaker and walk away from the paired device, taking my speaker with me all around my home, up and down the stairs with zero interruption of sound quality. So peace and happiness is again once known in the home.
<br>
<br>They reached out a week following to inquire if the trouble shooting helped or did they need to find another solution for me? With zero issues following the trouble shooting advice, I am very happy with their customer service, and no further action was needed.

Despite the previous good reviews on it, I didn't have high expectations for a speaker at this price. After it arrived I opened the finely packed box and it turned on right away and I was able to immediately pair my phone with it. It provides a quick ""beep"" sound to let you know when it is on, pairing, or turning off. Each sound is a little different but I liked it much more than speakers that have a voice for every action. Now, I'm not an expert when it comes to highs, lows, or sound in general. But I know what I like and I really like the sound quality, it provides decent bass for its size. It gets really loud without losing sound quality. It feels really sturdy, good weight, and firm buttons. I will give a 2-3 month update.

<br>
<br>They go into sync mode just fine and one out of 87 attempts it says it synched but it didn't. I even tried reset pair devices as a recommended two or three times and that didn't help I just had to re-pair all the devices that I had connected again.
<br>
<br>I have the X sound surf and the X sound go. The X sound go definitely has a much deeper and Fuller sound for only a 4-amp difference between the two if you're trying to decide which one you want to get (which is why I bought both because I figured I could just pair them when I was at home and take the surf places like the beach and pool without worrying about it. Then sync them at home for even better sound but no such luck) ugh?!!!
<br>
<br>I wish the surf sounded as good as the go because I really like the mobility of the surf and not having to worry about splashing around the pool or at the beach.
<br>
<br>My last ditch effort will be to return the go as much as I love the better sound and buy another surf and see if it's a difference between models although nothing in the documentation or the videos on YouTube say they anyone or device should have a problem synching different models especially when the original date of both is almost identical.

I think that I'm going to get another to take advantage of the stereo sound capabilities that 2 can do. It seems solidly built; could probably withstand a fall from a table or higher. The rubber feet help it from horizontal vibration movement. I haven't really turned the volume up, but the music can FILL a medium size room with clear MUSIC.

US,B07594HZ6Y,R1PPJISE65A2VN,SURPRISINGLY good little speaker!,Color:Black,"So a couple things before I do my review. This sounds as loud and quality as some of my 20w and 25w speakers. This is about the size of your hand or so, and feels heavy.
<br>
<br>Build:
<br>Matte hard plastic with rubber in places all around it. Rubber pads on the bottom to keep it stable on glass. Charging is USB-c. It is waterproof so everything in inlaid cutouts.
<br>
<br>Quality:
<br>The sound quality for this size is quite good. Like I said, this easily stands up to some of my 20w and even 25w speakers both in bass and in loudness before distortion. It does seem to be tuned to a nice balanced sound, maybe a little middle heavy, but for standard play this covers the whole gamut. I played music the other day on it for over 8 hours and it was still plowing forward without issue, so will assume their battery life count is at least close to on point. BT range seems around average, music continues to play when I moved my phone to another room, and it still played at around 40 feet away outside. My only complaint is that it is not aptX, but at this price point I cannot even take a star off for that.
<br>
<br>Sum up:
<br>This will be really hard to beat for this price. It is small and waterproof, has good bass, stays low distortion even at higher volume, and easily made it through a workday without battery life issues. Pretty solid buy.",是,5,BobOki,2022-01-18

So starting in November I just used a cable to plug it directly into my computer instead of bluetooth. Then, in December, it kept saying battery low and then failed completely. I would charge it up all night, and the next day it worked for about 20 minutes and then would say battery low and then fail. Again, I tried all the tricks - doing a factory reset, etc. So now I ALSO have to plug in the speaker to the wall because the battery won't hold a charge.

I haven't used it more that a 20 hours in total. Won't be trying to get it fixed, will just chalk it up to experience, and not buy cheap junk anymore.",是,1,Lindakoy,2021-12-21

<br>1) Bass is rich and deep.

<br>5) Has a long charging cable
<br>4) Battery life. I used once and I was impressed with it.
<br>
<br>Cons
<br>1) The only con I can think of is there's a spot on the volume level that its either to loud or not loud enough. Its on the lower end of the volume. It happens when I'm watching TV with it.

One of the speakers rattles a little on some sounds so I almost returned it (or them). However, this brand works with the Bluetooth on my Samsung TV, while another brand receives only stuttering interrupted sound. However, that brand has no problems with rattling with when playing music. Since I moved into a condo, I can't use my subwoofer surround sound set of speakers so the TWS feature is what I use now with the speakers about a foot on both sides of me. I also get good stereo separation when listening to music with TWS speakers that close to me. With regular speakers, the stereo does sound all that separated since they are so far away from your ears that it tends to blend together. With TWS speakers, you can tell if the song was recorded as stereo or mono, especially if you have oldies but goodies in your collection. I stopped using my receiver with floor standing speakers for music when I started listening with TWS speakers close to me. I guess it was a good discovery that was only made since I cannot play my music and TV as loud as I used to inside a house because of the thin walls associated with a condo.",是,4,d double-u,2021-12-15

<br>
<br>Obviously it can’t compare to the JBL Charge but for its cost, this thing does the job and more. While the bass thump isn’t anything to write home about, there’s definitely a little bit of kick to this little thing. The music sounds great across multiple genres and is very crisp, even picking up those undertones a lot of musicians throw in. It’ll definitely do the job room to room and even hanging out on the balcony outside.

<br>- Battery life (barely have to charge, usually play for an hour at a time)

The fact that a bluetooth speaker this small and cheap is tolerable to me is remarkable in itself, but this thing *actually sounds good??*
<br>
<br>I can't believe that I can actually listen to music on this thing and enjoy it. The sound is clear, natural and well balanced, even putting out upper bass/lower midrange frequencies, just enough to warm up the sound but that shouldn't even be physically possible on speakers this size. There are no lower bass frequencies whatsoever but that would definitely be impossible at this size. I also, as a picky audio guy, love the fact that it's a stereo speaker, as many of these only have one driver and so can't deliver a stereo field. You have to be fairly close to this to get the effect of a stereo field but it's there.
<br>
<br>This thing is hefty and feels built like a tank. Apparently it has a massive battery life which again is just silly for a product this cheap. It gets loud too. And it even has a 3.5mm input jack.
<br>
<br>I bought one of these as a gift and had to buy another one (again as a gift) after I heard how good it was. It's a perfect audio upgrade for a phone or laptop if headphones aren't an option. If you have cheap (&lt;$50) headphones, this probably sounds better than those, somehow.

Initially, I thought of getting my wife a small bluetooth shower speaker but decided to get this Tribit Speaker because it would be more versatile. She could use it in the shower to listen to the music and to belt out her singing talent. I attached a carabiner so she could hook it and slip it into the side pocket of her backpack while hiking. She could also put it on the small table while sitting out on the deck, or by the solo fireplace while enjoying starry nights, or by the fire ring while roasting some marshmallows. She could even put it on a nightstand by the bed to listen to the sound of nature to get her to sleep faster. But...she will not get it until Christmas and it definitely will be conditional whether or not she makes it to Santa's ""good' list. Hopefully, she will enjoy it.

US,B07594HZ6Y,R7C28LCN8JSCR,Superb sound for classical music,Color:Black,"I just received this and immediately started testing it with a recording of Handel’s organ concerto #13 (Peter Hurford,organist) that I have listened to on many systems since buying it in London 40 years ago when CDs first came out. I’m playing it now on Amazon Music on my old iphone 8.
<br>
<br>The treble and mid-range is excellent with none of the harshness or tinniness that is so common in cheap systems. The deep base is at least audible, but of course there are no 14” woofers in this little speaker.
<br>
<br>I want to get real blue-tooth woofers soon, but for now the convenience and quality of sound is a wonderful improvement.

<br>
<br>If you offered me a new Soundlink in exchange for the $30 Tribit I'd laugh in your face. The bass on the XSound is deeper, the highs crisper, and in overall comparison the Bose just sounded muddy. I'm hearing detail that I never heard before in master-quality streaming on TIDAL.

I have owned several bluetooth speakers over the years in the $25-$50 price range, and this is by far my favorite. (I expected to enjoy it more than other no-name brands I've experimented with over the years but I even enjoy it more than my Anker products). The sound is clean: the instruments sound like what they are (drums and cymbals are particularly reproduced nicely), voice is crisp, bass is resonant, and it's plenty loud for my purposes. Other speakers I've owned have sacrificed clarity by trying to deliver on bass, have had annoying power up and power off sounds* (my least favorite features, always), and I just sort of suffered through thinking I had to at this price point. Not anymore. This is everything I am looking for in a speaker at this price point.

It was close enough. The bass was close, but the highs were weaker. But in most situations, one won't notice the difference.

I charged the speaker with the included cable, and it worked great for a few days. Sound was amazing, the bluetooth connectivity was flawless, and all was good...until it came time to charge it again. I have USB-C cables all around my home, and I tried to charge the speaker using a different cable that didn't come with the speaker (shouldn't matter, it's all USB-C, right?). Well, the speaker didn't charge at all. I initiated a return with Amazon, and just before packaging it up to send back, I decided to try charging it with the cable it came with... and it worked... Oh well too late, Amazon was already sending a replacement unit my way, so I packaged this one up and sent it back.
<br>
<br>Replacement unit arrives just two days later, and it's brand new. Seal is still intact, all looks good. I charge it fully, connect it to my phone, play some music, leave the phone next to the speaker, and all is good. Then I decide to do something else in another room and bring my phone with me. Bluetooth completely stops working. The bluetooth transmission is so poor from only 20 ft away with an open line of sight. The music cuts in and out every second. I go behind one thin wall, and the music stops completely. I tested this a bit and sure enough, with a direct line of sight, the speaker receives a signal, but far too poor to actually listen to music. If you wanted to be in another room with your phone, all bets are off as it wouldn't work at all. Eventually it completely lost connection and played the tone it plays when it is searching for a BT signal.

You have to turn it back on everytime. And after a few times of that you will need to re sync it with your phone. Extremely annoying if you plan on using the speaker for more than just constant music playing. And yes it's a feature, not a specific problem with mine. I emailed them and they claimed it was to ""save battery"". Sure it does that. But I know the real reason they did it. The last model had a charging port that wore out after 1.5 years for most people including me. Wouldn't charge anymore. This model does have a new USB C charging port but after 3 months it already feels like it's loosening up. I feel it won't last just like the previous model and they knew it.

US,B07594HZ6Y,R7OKW1ZDTMHDF,Good Start but reviews are mixed,Color:Black,"The most interesting thing about this speaker are the reviews! They're either glowing or they cannot recommend buying.
<br>
<br>I've had my speaker for two days and it's been impressive. Good sound for such a small and inexpensive speaker. Bluetooth pairing was simple, there is no longer any need to update firmware, and the controls are simple. No complaints so far.
<br>
<br>But the negative reviews list several complaints including short battery life, cracking speakers, loss of connection, and water leakage.
<br>
<br>My plan is to keep the speaker connected to the power strip powering my computer. This should help regulate the in built rechargeable battery.
<br>
<br>The problem with rechargeable batteries is that they are easy to ruin. Leave the device in your drawer for a year and the battery will go empty and lose its ability to take a charge. Same goes for running it to empty. Eventually, all rechargeable batteries go dead, but the device should be able to run while plugged in. We will see.
<br>
<br>Cracking speakers is QC. Time will tell if I got good speakers.
<br>
<br>Connectivity issues appear to stem from using the aux port. This won't apply to me since I use Bluetooth with my iPhone. One irritating fact is that the speaker will transmit all sounds from the phone, including alerts and rings.
<br>
<br>Water leakage is also not an issue for me. Taking the speaker into the shower or submerging underwater is not normal use for electronics, no matter what the advertising. When they say water proof, they mean it can take some light rain while outdoors. That's common sense. Having dive experience with watches and lights, I know that true underwater operation will have gaskets and seals that need regular maintenance.
<br>
<br>So my plan is to update this review in the months and hopefully years to come. Wish me luck!",是,5,huntinghawk,2021-10-04

Connects well and when paired with my wife's speaker does great pairing in stereo. Manual leaves a lot to be desired. Not clear and lacking in information. Bet that led to a lot of returns. However what made me almost return both speakers turned out to be a CRAPPY usb-c cable. one speaker wouldn't charge with included cable {Recharged 1 time]. Light kept blinking and phone showed 80% charge at beginning and after 12 hrs. Second speaker recharged three times and then would'nt recharge also until I accidently lited the cable out of the way. Suddely the charging light turned solid and after a couple hours it fully charged so I used this cable on other speaker and after carefully massaging the cable from USB-C to wall charger light finally went solid and now both speakers were fully charged. On retry after this neither cable would recharge. Luckily I had a Quality USB-C cable and have had no further issues from speakers. Love the little speakers. They do everything they claim. To cheap out on charging cable seems rediculous.seeing problem was solved with old cable I had for a bluetooth transmitter. Cable was the the weak link in an otherwise satisfied purchase. Could have been a five star review if not for the cable.,否,3,john boffa,2021-09-20

My main objectives were rich sound, clarity for sporting events, volume and battery life. The speaker met all objectives in flying colors. The clarity for broadcasts is very impressive and the volume in the vehicle is more than adequate at 50-65% of full volume. I mostly use Pandora for music &amp; it sounds very very good to my ears. Due to it's small size, It fits perfectly in the center console area placed below the emergency break.
<br>
<br>Battery life is fantastic for the way I use the speaker. With volume mostly at low volume as well as a couple of hours at medium volume it lasted over 24 hours. (Documented time not guessing.)
<br>
<br>If it had a micro SD slot and the battery recharge time could be reduced from about 5 hrs to 3 hrs or less it would have been perfect.

I didn't expect this sound quality at this price or even double the price. This is just slightly longer than my cell phone and is easily held in one hand, so a small form factor.

<br>
<br>I started looking at the available Bluetooth speakers as I wanted something for the office and also to take along with me should I want to use it out of the office.
<br>
<br>I looked at a number of different models from a number of manufacturers. This one seemed to hit all my check boxes. 1) Portability 2) Sound quality 3) Battery life 4) Ease of use
<br>
<br>I ordered my unit and it arrived a couple of days later.
<br>
<br>I brought it into the office, powered it on, and in less than a minute I had music streaming through it. And let me tell ya, it sounded great! Not gonna try and tell you it's like a McIntosh hifi but for $41, I more than got my money's worth.
<br>
<br>I have had it over a month now, and I use it pretty much every day now. I did buy a USB A to USB C cable to charge it as the one that is included was pretty short. I didn't feel strongly about this as I could have made the included cable work, I chose to get a longer one.

I cant be more than like 3 feet away from it without it losing sound or connection. My phone cannot be in my pocket while connected or or on the other side of my body. If anything is inbetween your phone and the speaker goodbye music. No joke. I was trying to mow my low with it in my cargo pant and with my phone on the opposite side of the speaker it was having nothing but issues. As soon as I put it on the same side as the speaker (no body interference) then there was no more issues. You cant leave its side so basically you mine as well lose the bluetooth altogether and make it so we have a cord that connects our phone to it like a AUX cable.

I think the main difference is that the OontZ sounds slightly better if it's sitting on a hard flat surface, because it has a downward firing passive bass port. The Tribit has this passive port firing forward, so it can perform well in more cases, for example I tested each mounted to the handle bar of my bike...the Tribit sounds excellent and the OontZ sounds bad, because there's no flat surface in that scenario. So I like to leave the OontZ in one spot in my house where it sounds good, and the Tribit is the portable and most versatile solution to the other places where I want sound.

You don't even need to place this speaker on a surface or enclosure that resonates and gives you even deeper bass...Got plenty as it is...I've had other speakers of this kind, and even though they are a bit bigger in size and maybe a little louder, they don't really measure up to the sound of this little fellow...It also feels and looks very solid and compact..

US,B07594HZ6Y,R3D4QHD73A9FJW,Battery life lasts at most 12 hours with daily use,Color:Black,"I am blown away by this speaker! I looked around for a while for a good one, and was close to purchasing a well known brand for over $100. I took a chance knowing nothing of this brand, and oh man, does this thing sound good! The battery life does not last the advertised 24 hours, for continuous use to say the least. But, you can expect it to last 10-14 hours playing music full blast. The sound does not get distorted or blown out at full volume. I usually use my speaker to play ambient music to fall asleep to, and upon waking up, there is still plenty of battery left after an 8-9 hour sleep, and to play during the day to sit back and relax.
<br>
<br>One thing to be aware of: PLEASE be careful not to play music while the battery is charging. I read a review on how the charging seems to stop working after months of use while charging while playing if you do so, and it does effect the battery life span/charging port life span.
<br>
<br>I purchased my first one almost a year ago, which was the gen 1 model and the charging port broke after daily use about a week ago. Amazon was more than happy to send a replacement for FREE! Kudos to amazon for amazing customer satisfaction.

<br>
<br>Tip for users connecting to laptop or for PC sound, digout a cable and USE the 3.5mm Aux input when watching video as it will ELIMINATE the bluetooth latency (when you see someone's mouth moving and the audio trailing shortly behind).
<br>
<br>Another tip as other users have mentioned, find a piece of EQ software and adjust to your liking. I just opened up the Dolby Access App that was included on my laptop and tweaked it to my liking and it literally sounds as warm/rich as $200 Bose Soundlink mini.
<br>
<br>This is the perfect speaker to travel with and either utilize the bluetooth to listen to music/podcasts/speakerphone, that with a quick plug into laptop with a 3.5mm Aux also gives you low latency, warm, rich higher end soundbar audio for watching tv/movies or playing games. Given the impressively low price point, I may consider adding another one and trying out the two speaker stereo mode, which I'm sure sounds spectacular.

I didn’t even know how to say Tribit, so I asked them(yes they are super responsive online), it sounds like Tree-bit. I like that this guy is built for the element, pretty much weatherproof, and it’s small enough to carry it in your backpack. Take it to the beach, or a picnic, camping? Sure!! The sound this little speaker makes is enough to fill the room. Sure, I wouldn’t play anything with a lot of bass at 100% as it would start to distort the mids and highs. That’s how I blew my last speakers. Bluetooth technology has come a long way with a lot less lag(you usually sense it when you watch YouTube videos with speakers like these), and this are times better than the speaker on my iPhone obviously. I am super happy with the purchase, and for the money, I am even thinking about getting a 2nd unit. WHY? Because you can pair them and get Left AND Right channels. Yes, get a pair of these and go stereo(or party mode if you want).
<br>And another revolutionary one is the Tribit StormBox Micro. This, or rather these are high on my list. They are perfect as gifts, although I do wish they come in more exciting colors like Red, Green, Yellow, Purple, Teal maybe? And the micros do pretty much the same thing the XSound Go does, but in smaller package, and less volume. Pair these up and strap them on your bike handles and you got stereo sound while you’re riding. Genius! Good job Tribit! This is the type of innovation that we all need!",是,5,A. Tan,2021-08-09

US,B078TH3PHL,R19VX2B2DFSJYP,Unlikely to be beat for the price,Color:Blue,"For a cheap blutooth speaker it does the trick. It stopped pairing unexpectedly about the weeks into use and I had to reset it by first completely removing the device from my paired devices on my phone and then holding down the + and - on the speaker for a bit to hard reset it. Took a few tries bit I haven't had any issues in the couple of weeks since.
<br>
<br>The materials are durable which is great because I tend to beat on my portable speakers a bit. No signs of wear and tear after being tossed around at gymnastics with all of the chalk dust everywhere and it's surviving use in the currently wet and muddy garden.
<br>
<br>I use it for upward of 7 hours a day and get a few days out of it on a charge. The annoying thing is there's really no way to know how much battery you have left until it's nearly dead and it tells you. The charge is decently fast though and the usb c is a nice upgrade from micro.
<br>
<br>It gets reasonably loud, especially for its size, and the sound quality can't be beat by any in this price bracket. If you want a speaker in this price range, this is probably the one you want.",是,4,Evan K.,2021-07-18

I tried using it on a conference call, people complained that my voice was soft and they had a hard time hearing me.

<br>I think one of the reviewers is right. This speaker is not much better than the old Creative Lab PC speaker. The good is it can get loud and the sound is clear.

<br>The Manual does not say anything re stereo pairing leading me to believe they didn't want to spend the money to make an appropriate Manual for the upgraded (stereo) version so they just send the older mono version's Manual...great they send you the wrong Manual. More serious issue is the ad says the version I ordered is the upgraded version. Since the Manual does not indicate whether it has the stereo or how to set it up if you have two speakers; and since the packaging doesn't tell you whether you have the upgraded version or the older mono version, you don't know which version they sent you until you open the package and set it up.

<br>I am not a fan of the goofy sounds it makes when pressing the buttons.

<br>And the overall design! Why do they think black buttons on a black case is a good idea? Unless you are in bright light the buttons are invisible. I guess if you use it all the time it can be like touch typing, automatic, but if you are a casual user you may be forced to pick it up when you need to change a setting.",是,3,A. Heeschen,2021-06-30

It is heavy, so that means it is constructed well, it sounds great and i took it on the lake and it got extremely wet. NO PROBLEMS! This thing is so loud and sound is so clear....it had me and my son on the lake testing its capabilities. We were seriously seeing how loud we could get it without distortion.......and OMG...none...no distortion. We were on our kayak in middle of lake and volume turned up.....no distortion and people easily football field away could hear our music loud and clear.

Including a carabiner or using a strap with an adjustment bead would have been infinitely more helpful.

US,B07594HZ6Y,R3R0WWZTUYHKQ9,Very good budget speaker you won't be disappointed.🎶📻,Color:Black,"Was undecided between this and OontZ 3 ultra so I brought both to compare. To me the Tribit has much better sound, better bass and clarity at low volume (I'm not always at a party) just needed something for the beach and hotel room to chill to. I mostly listen to smooth jazz and the sound from the Tribit was hands down the best. If your undecided about this and another brand get both and compare with the kind of music you'll be listening to I think Tribit will win you over. And to be fair the star rating is for a budget speaker it's not a ""Bose"" 😎",是,5,Darryl G,2021-06-13

I was amazed by the quality of the sound and loudness of the bass that came out of the tiny speaker. The speaker is about the size of my hand but has the power to compete with top brand contenders. That is why when my speaker stopped charging i was very sad. The battery on my tribit no longer took the charger and it stopped lighting up to signal that it was charging. For a few months i was hesitant to call customer service because i always had bad experiences with other customer services. I ended up calling almost a year later to see if i qualified for a replacement. I had the luck to talk to Ms. Mona. After a few voice messages and some emails later, she was able to make sure i got sent a replacement in no less than a week since i called. I was beyond pleased with the length that they would go to make sure their customers were happy. I truly appreciate this brand and will be buying from there forever. Your work does not go unnoticed.

US,B07594HZ6Y,R2AU8BGKT9XN17,Nice Bluetooth Portable Speaker for the Money. GREAT FOR CLASSIC CAR ENTHUSIAST,Color:Black,"It was EXACTLY what I needed for my application. I own a classic car and didn't want to compromise the original radio and speakers. I wanted a speaker that was loud enough to be heard over the rumble of my Big Block Motor and still provide nice clear sound. I was able to easily hook up to my Galaxy Note phone and listen to music on apps like Spotify and SiriusXM. The speaker is small enough and heavy enough to be placed on my center dash without any obstruction. I could put behind the seat but preferred an unobstructed sound from the 15 watt stereo speakers. Not sure if I can, but curious if I can purchase a second unit and have them both run off my Bluetooth together for richer sound. Not sure yet if the battery life is as advertised but don't anticipate needed more than 10 hours of run time and anytime and since it's charged via USB, I could always connect a small portable charger or even my cigarette lighter.
<br>
<br>The only negative I have at this point is that the bass is too strong and no adjustment. I realize today's kids like that BASS, but I'm not a kid and don't like a strong bass.

The bass is actually pretty strong as well. I was in search for some computer speakers, but i ended up going for a bluetooth speaker for the added use of connecting my phone to it. The updated model of this speaker does have USB-C charging capability and includes a USB-C cable, for those who wanted to be sure, as this was one of the features I wanted in a wireless speaker. This does not, however, include a 3.5mm audio jack cable, so you would have to buy one separately if you don’t already have one.

I do not recommend for a shower/bath speaker unless you have a very open room.

<br>On the plus side, the device is solidly built and feels nice. It's functions very well with Bluetooth connectivity and battery life is great. I've only charged it once since purchasing. Can't accurately say if it is indeed ""24h"" as no one will realistically run speakers that long.

The first one accidentally got thrown away but I liked it so much that I replaced it with the same speaker. However, within a few months, the new speaker would no longer charge when plugged in. Since I wasn't sure if the speaker was still under warranty, I contacted Tribit. They gave me some suggestions to try to get it to charge and assured me that it was still under warranty and not to worry as the problem would be resolved. When I wrote back that I'd tried their suggestions, but the speaker wasn't charging they told me that they would send a new one and that I didn't have to return the old one. Not only was this a totally hassle-free replacement but the new speaker arrived in two days. Now, I don't judge a product or manufacturer one on problem item because this happens to even the best product.

I think this was probably referring to more advanced models. No indication as to what the lights mean, -- indications for a weak battery, etc. Just the usual frustration because they don't want to spend time and money trying to explain it to us.

I'm going to buy a second one just like it. It also makes me able to stream Sirusxm from my phone to that speaker and WOW, what a difference. Now I won't have to go to the computer just to stream some music.
<br>
<br>LOVE love love this speaker. It was only $32, too. If it said Bose on it, I'd believe it was. I almost bought a Bose speaker and it had rotten reviews and was more money. This one had great reviews and so I'm adding mine to the long list.
<br>
<br>I'll be dancing to tunes while cleaning house. And I THINK it will even work in the car so when I'm using the GPS on the phone, the audio parts of the instructions should be loud and clear. No more holding the phone so I can hear what it's trying to say! The only problem with that would be if the GPS is quiet too long the speaker will shut itself off and I'll have to remember to turn it back on.

To me it sounded like an AM radio. No bass at all. I know being a very tiny speaker it would not have the bass some reviewers claimed but again, didn’t expect it to sound the way it did. Also, not sure if it was the shape, but the sound was a lot better and louder if it was layer on it’s back, which is not possible. While sitting on it’s side like it should be the music was quite a bit lower. Sad it didn’t sound better because it was really cute and small. Handy to take on the go.

I’m not an audiophile by any means, but this speaker has amazing bass response for its size. It also has phenomenal audio quality and I’m hearing much crisper vocals than I have on any other portable speaker (and I’ve used several in this price range plus the JBL flip 3). For the last couple years I’ve used the AOMAIS Sport II, and it’s been pretty solid but has recently started to break down on me. I decided to buy this and the Oontz Angle 3 Ultra as it also had great reviews. After listening to both the Oontz and the Tribit speakers, I think the Tribit is the way to go hands down. It had better bass response and an overall higher audio quality for mids and highs as well. Don’t get me wrong the Oontz 3 Ultra is also a great speaker for the price, but this one is better. Only con I’ve noticed so far is the max volume level is a bit lower than other comparable speakers (it still gets pretty loud though).",是,5,Jovaughn,2021-03-19

US,B07594HZ6Y,R25ICR48BV4WJ4,Pretty Good little Speaker~,Color:Black,"I couldn't convince myself to splurge on a minor sidekick speaker so took a chance on this little speaker and it is quite good. The biggest drawbacks are that it can't push out the deep base notes so classical music with cellos and basses will not be rendered well. or at all. Also, it ""cllings"" to one bluetooth device at a time so one you fix it to one, you have to manually reset the device to set it to another player if you need to. The volume controls will amplify the signal volume a little higher but not by much.
<br>Very nice speaker for a little quiet time out in the garden or in your study. Good value. Looking forward to seeing what other innovations come up with this company.

US,B07594HZ6Y,R2B964NW4NGJ0R,Sounds like a much more expensive speaker.,Color:Black,"I bought this based on the many 5-star reviews and have not been disappointed. Simple process to link Bluetooth to iphone (several good you tube tutorials which help the digitally disadvantaged like me). The linking procedure takes about 2 minutes at most. Once linked the speakers produce excellent sound, far better than I expected for a $36 speaker (with free shipping). The speaker will pick up the iphone signal from at least 20 feet away, maybe more. The sound does not deteriorate with either high or low volume. It is always crisp with good solid bass and highs that are smooth but not thin or tinny. I realize that these are inexpensively made and have some plastic parts, but if it lasts a year it will be well worth the price--that's $3.00 a month. I'll just buy another when this wears out.

<br>I left it charging overnight and it was still blinking in the morning...

<br>2 stars due to the battery problem.

I am not here to hate on an affordable BT pill, nor was I expecting superior sound quality, but what I wasn't expecting was the sheer number of shilled reviews! Its incredible to think anyone in their right mind would think these were passable for any kind of sound playback. At best, they are sub-quality 1997 computer speakers from CreativeLabs.

What the Wirecutter review won't tell you is that the bluetooth behavior of this unit is fatally flawed-- if you turn it on without pairing it to a device (such as to use it with an aux-in), it will aggressively try to pair with all the bluetooth devices in its wireless range, regardless of whether it's paired with them before, including the devices in your neighbors' apartments. There is no way to turn this behavior off and there is no software update.

US,B07594HZ6Y,R92VSNZA0UCOM,Make sure you received the speaker you ordered.,Color:Black,"I ordered a tribit Bluetooth speaker after hearing my neighbor’s Maxsound plus. I figured 16w would be plenty for the small areas Where I would be using it. I was sent the Xsound go and was rally underwhelmed by the sound quality. I finally decided to return it and when I packaged it back up the label on the box showed it was a 12w XSoundGo. The speaker I received was neither loud nor with a rich bass sound. I decided to give the Stormbox speaker a shot. The Stormbox does have a bass boost button but I it doesn’t have the same volume of the maxsound plus. That may be due to the Stormbox 360° sound, but I wish it was louder.
<br>
<br>I contacted the customer service line for Tribit and I am not sure if they have outsourced their customer service or have CSRs that are not fully versed in the different products Tribit offers. I would have definitely benefitted from speaking to someone who knew the products better and would have suggested the best speaker for my needs.

US,B078TH3PHL,R1F7BZPF064X2U,Great sound for the price,Color:Blue,"I ordered this speaker to replace an old JBL Flip 2 that just up and died on me. The Tribit Xsound Go sounds at least as good, maybe a tad better. I like my music to sound as accurate as possible and the Go does pretty well in that regard - the bass, mid-range, and treble frequencies are fairly well balanced. Balanced sound lends itself well to the kinds of music I listen to, but, if you're a hard rocker person, the bass coming from this unit will probably not meet your needs. I tried cranking the volume up and the thing plays plenty loud. The box contained a USB-C charging cable and the speaker paired easily with my laptop and phone. The advertisement on this device claims that it is waterproof, something I don't plan to try out but is a nice bonus... Overall I would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a moderately priced bluetooth wireless speaker that performs well.",是,4,Ruben Rodriguez,2021-01-28
US,B07594HZ6Y,R25EFXH1XAHJI1,Sound level is dependent on how high volume is turned up on Bluetooth device.,Color:Black,"I’m really disappointed in the volume level of this device, I have it Bluetooth to my TV so I can listen to my music channels. I keep the volume low on the TV so as not to blast it in the house. However when I try to turn volume up on Bluetooth speaker it doesn’t go high enough to hear it unless I crank up TV volume. Same with IPad or phone , unless I crank up the speaker volume on either one of those the speaker is hardly loud enough to hear, the volume up/down buttons on the speaker are useless.

I left it charging for probably 5 hours after the first use. The flashing ""charging light"" was still flashing so maybe it has to be charged for a lot longer, because the next time I used it, it lasted about 20 minutes. I charged it for a couple more hours, and it worked for maybe an hour. Charged it forever last night, played four songs this morning, and the battery was dead again. You can't charge it and play it at the same time either. The battery isn't replaceable. I wouldn't recommend this unless you only want to use it one time.",是,2,Mal,2021-01-28

US,B07594HZ6Y,R2JRNF6GW7XBXX,Suprisingly good sound from tiny box,Color:Black,"Summary: excellent sound from a box the size of your hand. Rock solid, heavy construction. Excellent battery life. Has both Bluetooth and an AUX input.
<br>
<br>Bought for the Bath (in conjunction with a wall mounted monitor and firestick TV). I was not expecting much from the Tribit given its diminutive size, however the volume, frequency range and clarity are all excellent. This might not fill an opera hall with sound but it provide ample volume to both the bathroom and adjacent master bedroom. So I was delighted.
<br>
<br>I have the Tribit attached to the monitor via the AUX input (as my display does not have internal speakers). I should say the Tribit's sound is superior to any computer monitor (with internal speakers) or low end TV I've encountered to-date.
<br>
<br>I have not decide whether to buy a second Tribit for the full stereo experience (they can be paired so one speaker becomes the left-hand-side and the other the right-hand-side). May be overkill for the bath experience!
<br>
<br>You do need to provide your own usb-c charger but like most people, I suspect, I had several lying around the house. For portable use I might find the 5 hour recharge time to be slow (my phone with a similar size battery does a fast-charge in under an hour).
<br>
<br>Overall, the ergonomics, simplicity and sound quality make this a good buy. I will probably buy another for my workshop as I like background music (connected by bluetooth to my phone). I haven't attempted to use the built-in microphone (which I presume was intended for the phone?) so cannot comment on this feature.",是,5,Alastair G. Stell,2021-01-26
US,B07594HZ6Y,R1AMTNKS1F4392,Better than my expectations!,Color:Black,"What a find! And what a save! I was disappointed after buying a 2017 boat with a good stereo, only to find that there were all kinds of problems so that regardless of what function I was using, the best I could do was to get only two of four speakers playing and never both channels. I wanted to be able to listen to either an iPod or Pandora. This little speaker device saved the day, and did it in a big way. I'm not one to blast music all over the water. I just want music for my passengers and myself and this Tribit delivers! Excellent balanced sound quality. Plenty of volume. Maybe a little light on the bass response, but that's understandable considering the size. No distortion at maximum volume. Blue tooth connectivity with my Samsung Galaxy was too easy. (And the Tribit arrived with enough battery charge to set it up and play it for a good while.) For my purposes in conjunction with my phone, this will be just perfect. The stereo on the boat had lots of small multifunction buttons and was not at all intutitive to use. The combination of the Tribit and my phone is a piece of cake. Haven't tested the battery life.

<br>
<br>It is a low prices speaker so don't expect an audiophile item it is not meant to be for audiophiles, it doesn't support APTX or HD sound via bluetooth but compared to most speakers of this size and price, it sounds extremely good compared to them, it sounds really good for a speaker of this price range.
<br>USB C doesn't mean it will fast charge but it's still great that it's USB C like most products now but It won't charge using Usb c to usb c cables, only the USB C to USB.
<br>
<br>It is great for youtube for those with low volume phones, latency is good, something that JBL has issues with, so you don't have to worry about a video that has audio and the characters mouth movements out of sync.
<br>
<br>Ok everybody talks about the bass, yes bass is good but again compared to speakers of this price range and size, yes there's some like Sony speakers with better bass but it's a whole different price range and you just can't compare an item thats focused on budget with one focused on quality. So for this speaker yes the bass is good for this speaker, it's better than Pints and probably any other 35 dollar speaker out there but you have to understand that it is a small speaker and the bass is not something deep and powerful, it's impossible to expect a speaker this small to have some thumping bass, I say the bass is just perfect for what this speaker is.

<br>
<br>Problem one is that the bluetooth connection likes to take a shit sometimes. It's not often, but it's annoying.
<br>
<br>Problem two is that the speaker automatically turns itself off after it isn't used for a bit, even when plugged in. It makes sense when not plugged in, but it would be nice to have it always on when battery is no issue.
<br>
<br>Problem 3, the biggest one, is that this speaker has a microphone in it. Any time the microphone is in use the speaker changes from headphone to headset mode which makes the audio sound like crap (like a phone call). It's not an option or a switch. Any time any program on your computer tries to use the microphone (Starcraft 2 seems to use all of your recording devices at once for no reason even when you aren't using voice) it will switch to that mode until you can track down the program and stop it from using it as a mic. Sometimes the device itself even bugs out and switch to the mode for seemingly no reason and doesn't stop until you reset it. The built-in mic sounds terrible so it would be better if it just didn't exist.",是,3,Amazon Customer,2021-01-07
US,B07594HZ6Y,R3S5M93T633AVO,Buttons Very Difficult to Press,Color:Black,"We chose the Tribut XSound over less expensive choices for its good reviews and supposedly better sound quality. I think it has too much bass for listening to talk shows or audible books, but good for music. Pairing with iPhone and Echo speaker was easy. The only thing we truly dislike is the buttons, the Power button and the Volume buttons. They are extremely hard to push to activate. My husband thought I was crazy, but once he tried using them, he thought they didn’t work at all. I told him to push really, really hard. Literally, I cannot change volume unless I am standing. We haven’t decided whether to keep it or send it back yet. We are not using the buttons to change volume, instead we use the phone, Alexa or Echo to adjust the volume. Even the power button is hard to press to turn off and on. Maybe it’s that way for the waterproofing, but it is a definite negative for the speaker.",否,3,Internet Shopper,2021-01-07

US,B07594HZ6Y,R1XGQ8C5V1GSK6,Excellent for the size and price,Color:Black,"The size and rubbery texture and rounded shape all make it comfortable to grab, move around, or throw in a bag. The buttons also feel good. They're easy to press, but hard to press accidentally which is rare and perfect. The button symbols are large but they are just raised rather than a contrasting color so they can be hard to see at times. I like that the power button is on top and not some switch in the back. Surprisingly solid. Pairs easily with decent range. Battery life is decent but I'd like more warning when it's low. It does provide that info to paired devices so I am able to see it's battery remaining % when I connect it to my phone.

<br>Much better sound quality than I would expect for the size and price. Like anything else this small, it won't beat much larger speakers or a set up with a dedicated subwoofer, but for a system that fits comfortably in one hand, it sounds great.",是,5,MidnightSun,2021-01-06

<br> The Anker sound core and the Tribit go were comparable to each other. The tactile feel of the Anker was ideal. Tribit go has a smooth finish with hard to feel and see buttons. The Anker and Tribit both sounded good with the Anker having a bit more bass if that's what your looking for. What makes the Tribit go the winner for me was the volume.

They're tinny, bass response is better than expected but it's the sound timbre is not great and muffled sounding. What frustrates me the most is the really uneven volume across the audio spectrum. Certain sounds, particularly around speaking frequencies are quite loud while others are barely audible. Trying to adjust sounds with the volume controls is unsatisfactory, the jumps are much to large. Trying to fix the reproduction with an equalizer hasn't really helped. Even if it did, it would still be unacceptable in my opinion. I read a review that these have the best sound reproduction in there class, but I'm not sure what speakers they got. I've heard much better reproduction from other bluetooth speakers before.

<br>
<br>But if you want a speaker for audiobooks, unfortunately this speaker is really not suited for that purpose. The problem is that when audiobooks transition from one chapter to another (I'm using Audible), the speaker drops the first 1-3 seconds of the new chapter. It basically just cuts out, meaning you don't hear the chapter names and usually the first half of the first sentence of that chapter. If you're listening to a book with long chapters this is moderately disruptive. But some books I listen to are just a few pages per chapter which means every 2-3 pages you're missing the start of the chapter!
<br>
<br>I suspect what's happening technically is that the speaker is detecting the stream has gone absolutely silent and so it goes into some power saving mode or something, but the stream hasn't really finished it's just moving from one chapter to another. If Tribit were to fix this it would be perfect. But I'm now on the hunt for another speaker to replace it because of this problem.",是,3,mix whit,2020-12-09

US,B07594HZ6Y,R22G6K3F9SFZV5,"Sound quality is legit but bluetooth and charging are not,",Color:Black,"I bought this for use at the office to have background sound on while I work. It has been in use every weekday for the last two months. In short, the sound quality is clear for both podcast listening and listening to music. However, the USB-C port and Bluetooth are dodgy.
<br>
<br>PROS
<br>-The sound quality is clear. Noticeable bass when listening to music.
<br>-Light and compact pill form. It stays on my office desk, but it could easily fit into my backpack without taking up too much space.
<br>-Light indicator changes color and pattern dependent on status (i.e. playing, finding Bluetooth, charging, playing while charging).
<br>
<br>CONS
<br>-Charging is hit and miss. I can usually get it charged to around 60% but then it stops charging. I found out that the connection at the USB-C port is somewhat loose. So, when I notice that it has stopped charging, I have to wiggle the charging cable ever so slightly and try to keep it in position so it can continue charging. I tried charging with a cable that I use for my phone and other devices and I got the same result.
<br>-Bluetooth is fine most of the time when connecting to my phone but every now and then, I have to reset the connection to get it to connect. I have two other portable speakers that have been in use longer and I have not had this type of issue with those speakers.",是,3,C,2020-12-08

No issues pairing with my cell phone (iPhone SE) and the control buttons are adequately sized and they are also raised, so it is easy to adjust the volume or push the Bluetooth button ( usually this is not necessary) when pairing. The sound quality is excellent. I owned an older series JBL Charge Bluetooth speaker, and while the quality isn't quite as good, it's very close. The high &amp; midrange notes come through crisp and clear with no distortion, even with the volume cranked up. The only issue I've had is distortion on some lower bass notes, even at a low volume. This is pretty obvious when listening to hip-hop/rap music and some classical music with extended bass notes on drums, bass, or piano. I am contemplating contacting the seller to see if I can get a replacement, as it is possible that the speaker is defective. I think this speaker deserves a solid 4-star rating because it produces sound that is comparable to speakers that are 2-3x as expensive.

US,B07594HZ6Y,RAGIWE4VPLETU,A very fine clarity and great balanced sound...,Color:Black,"First, I spent way too much time trying to decide on which one to get. I did purchase the XLeader Sound Angel without too much research, it was cheap and highly reviewed, and a great entry for me into BT speakers. I'm a senior and thought BT was some kind of involved technical installation. I like(d) the Sound Angel and the world it introduced me to. But now I wanted to expand, especially when I found that my girlfriend's old little BT speaker sounded way better, louder and fuller than the Sound Angel.
<br>
<br>The Tribit had so many great reviews, a good sign. But one review really impressed me, when the reviewer compared several speakers in this price range and a competitor has ""a much more bigger bass, but it does NOT give as rich a reproduction as the Tribit which captures the trebles and bass PERFECTLY""...
<br>
<br>I think we may be swayed by bass response, and I have found that sometimes the bass can be overwhelming and take away from the quality of sound.
<br>
<br>The Tribit is plenty loud but indeed, the sound is excellent and clear. The only complaint I have is that the highs can be kind of piercing, like a jazz trumpet recording, I noticed this with a Dizzy Gillespie recording. But then again, for about $30, I don't know if complete perfection is possible.
<br>
<br>I pretty much keep it in the kitchen, and listen in there but my office is just outside the kitchen, and I love the way it sounds about 10 feet from me. For just about $14 more than the Sound Angel, it is no comparison. But the little Sound Angel may still have some value and get some usage. But if I knew how much better the Tribit is, I wouldn't have got the Sound Angel.
<br>
<br>The Tribit is smart too, though I haven't used some of it's features.
<br>
<br>I find items with super high ratings to be worthy of consideration. Five weeks and it is used everyday. Being a guy who grew up in the '60s with vinyl and big speakers, this new world of digital music is just a gas!",是,5,KnightinTunisia,2020-11-23

US,B07594HZ6Y,R2UN5V1BSPN7ZL,"Great sound, annoying switching between devices",Color:Black,"Pros:
<br>-small, portable, lightweight

<br>-blue color is lovely and sophisticated (I gave the black to a relative as a gift and later was given the blue)
<br>
<br>Cons:
<br>-doesn't have ""skip"" button
<br>-switching between devices (if using Bluetooth) is a pain: you always have to disconnect Tribit from the last device you had it paired with from within the settings on that device *before* you can connect it to another device from within the settings on the other device, even if the other device is closer to the Tribit and you've paired them a hundred times. I can't tell you how many times I've gone to another room with my Tribit and a device only to find that the Tribit is still paired with another device, so I have to go back to the other room and open up the other device, login, and change the settings (and that's assuming that I remembered correctly which device it was last paired with). It just gets annoying and sometimes frustrating when I am otherwise having a good flow to the day.",是,4,darling7,2020-11-23

US,B07594HZ6Y,R30IVIGCLHA70I,Best speaker for your value,Color:Black,"These speakers are awesome. Bought the first one for my dad a few christmases ago, he ended up getting one for my mom, and now I’m buying one for myself and my husband. Great sound quality and it gets nice and loud, unlike a lot of Bluetooth speakers I’ve had where the sound barely amplifies my phone. The battery life is awesome, we’ve used it with continuous music playing for a few hours before it died, but we always just plugged it into an outlet when it does. Sound quality is great, not grainy or distorted at all and only skips if you step away with the music source quite far. We’ve had music playing while we were in the pool outside and my father was able to bring his phone inside and across the home with no connectivity issues. Love this little thing! It’ll be great as a color guard coach as well so the kids can clearly hear the music while they’re all spaced out with flags and band noise going on around them.",否,5,Kristina Patel,2020-11-22
US,B07594HZ6Y,RFZCVCL14FYL3,Outperformed my expectations,Color:Black,"I've been using this in my kitchen for over a month now and have been very impressed. I consider it to have ""boombox-quality"" sound in an incredibly small package and an even more impressive price. It's pretty heavy for its size, so that explains it somewhat. It has pretty good thumping bass. Of course it's not the same quality as a surround-sound system or a big stereo, but it's in no way ""tinny."" It will fill the whole room with sound, and I almost never want to leave it turned all the way up for long.
<br>
<br>I have found that when I set it on top of a canister, under the upper kitchen cabinets, so that it can resonate out of a boxy space measuring about 1'x1'x2' it is seriously impressive. Or even just setting it about 6"" from any wall, it amplifies the bass.
<br>
<br>As to battery life, I have charged it once or twice but I don't even know what the low battery indicator looks like. I bought it because it was the best-recommended bluetooth speaker on Wirecutter that I could afford, and I had a hard time believing it could really be enjoyable to listen to, but it has really measured up.",否,5,Kindle Customer,2020-11-22

The Poweradds have more bass, but lack in clarity. This speaker shines in clarity and has enough bass to sound good. The VTIN was about the same size as this speaker but there was no bass to be found any where. The Tribit weighs about twice as much as the VTIN even though they are the same size. This indicates that the Tribit has high quality drivers in it with big magnets. Super happy with this speaker.",是,5,MCRS,2020-11-21

US,B07594HZ6Y,R1WV9LHJQ80UCE,Great sound in a small speaker,Color:Black,"The Sound Go is a great little compact speaker. I've used it for about a week and have been impressed with the sound quality, very clean sound with little to no distortion at 100% volume I've noticed.
<br>
<br>While the bass is not chest thumping, it does move the speaker when the volume is turned higher and is adequate given the size of the speakers.
<br>
<br>I use this more as an indoor speaker, while the Sound Go is very portable I would consider something like the MaxSound Plus for its bigger sound for outdoor use.
<br>I use this about 4hrs a day at 50-65% voulme and the battery still has 80% left before charging each day. I have rinsed it off in the sink with no issues. The usb-c is nice, need just one cable for both phone and speaker.
<br>
<br>Things that could be improved or changed are:
<br>
<br>The description is confusing has it says it's 16 watts but is actually 12watts?
<br>The buttons are kinda small and hard to see, could be better if they were a different color or ""raised"" more.
<br>It does get pretty loud at 100% but wish it was a few decibels louder at lower volumes.

Yes, it's a great little BT speaker. Yes, it's the best value in the category, and has great battery life. The sound quality and stereo field are surprising, but the bass is not overbearing or mushy.
<br>
<br>However, it bears pointing out that this is, in the end, a disposable product. All vibrating components are screwed into a plastic shell. This means the thing will eventually develop sympathetic vibrations and begin to buzz with lower frequencies at higher volumes.
<br>
<br>I've had mine for two years (the previous 12w, mini-USB port version), and I used it extensively for about 12 months. It's been on a shelf for the last 9 or 10 months. At volumes where it was tight and great before, it now does the buzzy case thing at even 50% volume with moderately bassy frequencies. Carefully prying out the front grate and checking all the screws for tightness revealed all had loosened about a 16th turn, but tightening them down made no difference to the new buzzes.
<br>
<br>A truly excellent product intended to last would have a metal frame for the speaker and radiator mount, but that's just not in the cards for a product at this price point. In short, expect this unit to start vibrating itself apart after about a year of regular use.",是,4,M. Carlson,2020-11-13

Also, it fits nicely under the iMac screen. See photo. Good solution!
<br>
<br>Note: I could not plug this unit into the Mac for charging as it hums when connected to the iMac audio outlet and USB-2 ports simultaneously.

It was smaller than I expected but mostly did not disappoint. One hidden feature that I did not see listed anywhere is that if you have 2 of these speakers you can pair them together and get stereo sound (see picture). I was not able to test this as I only had one. The audio is very clear and has decent bass. I wish it had more bass but it is good for the size of the speaker. You can crank it up and make it super loud with no audio distortion. It has nice buttons on the top: Power, Bluetooth, Play/Pause, Volume Down, and Volume Up. On the back there is a USB-C port for charging and an AUX port, both protected by a silicone cover. It has rubber nubs on the bottom to keep it from slipping and vibrating on the surface. It has a good amount of weight to it and comes with a carrying strap. The build quality is excellent and is solid all around, no corners were cut when designing this thing. I had another similar sized speaker I bought a while ago from another company that was about the same price, it's battery doesn't last long anymore which is why I bought a new one. This one outshines it in every way. I highly recommend this if you want an excellent portable speaker.

<br>Pros:
<br>Pair 2 of them together for stereo sound
<br>Crystal clear audio

US,B07594HZ6Y,R1WMLS806ZV2DE,Perfect addition to my sauna,Color:Black,"I bought this speaker well over a year ago to use in my outdoor sauna. Yes a sauna, 6' x 6' x 6' insulated wooden structure where an electric heater heats up stones that heat up the inside air, which usually goes up to 90 degrees celsius and frequently releases intensely hot steam. It doesn't get that hot on the floor where the speaker is put, but anyway, it's quite an extreme condition for an electronic device such as a speaker. And this little speaker has been working amazingly well so far.
<br>
<br>I don't have to worry about it getting wet, the battery lasts more than a week in my use (a couple of hours per day), and the sound quality is unbelievable for this size and price. However, after about a year of use in the harsh condition, it started to sound distorted in the bass, and the front grill got some rust probably from the high humidity.
<br>
<br>Since I did not expect it to last much longer in that kind of harsh environment, I just went ahead and bought a new one, this time the newer model that supports BT5.0 (XSound Surf). And that's where I learned about the famous 18-month warranty. I sent an email to the customer support as it was still within 18 months from the purchase, and I received a new unit in a few days without any hassle. This was the most impressive warranty policy and customer service for me in many years, which inspired me to write this review to help Tribit continue doing the good job.
<br>
<br>I'm using the newer XSound Surf in my sauna, which is another great speaker at an even lower price and I'm thinking of getting another to use two at the same time in TWS, but I have to admit that I miss the XSound Go's 24 hour battery life when I charge the Surf as it's more often. Also it feels like XSound Go sounds slightly better, though I have not done any side-by-side comparison.",是,5,mo,2020-10-21

I can honestly say that I have NEVER had better customer service. Their response was quick and they were willing to replace the speaker immediately after their two fixes did not resolve my problem. The old speaker had a Micro USB charging port (is that the right term?) which I've had connectivity issues with on many products! The new one is USB-C and I don't expect to have the same issues with charging again.",是,4,bettina,2020-10-20

US,B07594HZ6Y,R2UZSUH62HBI25,Balanced sound for jazz; switching sources is a bit of a pain,Color:Black,"After a lot of research on the many top contenders for best blue tooth speaker, I answered the question this way - how large did I want the device to be in my life. Since I have a component based hi-fi system and wasn't looking to compete with it, the answer was 'not large'. So that narrowed down the choices to a few in the price range of the Tribit. A couple of youtube videos helped in which the Xsound Go sounded less tinny and shrill than the others. I listen mostly to jazz in various formats and have to say it's sound has been balanced for the purpose. Since neither my iPhone 6SE and Lenovo T470S have great sound, the Xsound Go does the job which is provides much more listening pleasure out of these two sources.
<br>
<br>Pairing it to the iPhone took less than 5 seconds. Pairing it to the Lenovo laptop after that proved to be more of a puzzle, it would simply not see the device. Prompt customer service assistance from Tribit helped me figure it out. Once paired to a source, it cannot be paired to a second source (even if the first one has it's bluetooth turned off) unless you reset the Xsound Go. The way to do that is to turn it on and press the (-) and (+) buttons together for 5 seconds until you hear it beep. Then turn bluetooth on at the second source and search for / pair it. Do the reverse to get it paired back to the first source, but you may have to 'forget' the device first and re-pair it fresh. Fortunately I won't have to do it often, but it made me realize that a bluetooth speaker than can pair two devices at one time is a real convenience.",否,5,AP,2020-10-18

It sounds better when it's loud, but I just wanted this to use around the house, and not to blow up some beach party or something. It sounds like it's designed to be played super loud.

I like that I can take it anywhere, especially at work where I work with kids. There is one down side. The connectivity. This bluetooth speaker is supposed to have a long range of 60 feet? Or something like that. But I am not even over 10 feet and the music stops playing. I have to leave my phone next to the speaker so it won't cut out. And then sometimes my phones display light will turn off (to save energy) and the music stops playing. I have to touch my screen for the music to play. I don't know. I had this thing for almost a month now. I use this for my classroom and I don't want to leave my phone next to it and hope that my students will not be tempted to touch my phone because they wanna see which Kidz Bop Song is playing. I don't know if this is a spotify issue, I highly doubt it but the fact that music keeps getting cut off is extremely annoying and what would be the point in buying this?
<br>
<br>I am willing to change my review if I can get someone to help me understand why my music keeps getting cut off. It's as if the bluetooth is weak. I even use it at home, I walk less than 10 feet, and It connectivity fails, music gets cut off until I walk near the speaker again. I am moving around my classroom, and it gets cut off too. It's not even a big room. It's the connectivity that is the problem. That's it.

<br>So what do I mean by ""while it lasted"". Well, it now seems like somehow the bass speakers blew and I almost cant listen to it like this 😑.

<br>.
<br>Cons (compared to what I had):
<br>* The controls are very 'low profile' / smooth against the speaker. I often listen to audiobooks for a while after turning out the lights and going to bed, so I miss having the tactile feedback of the Oontz's buttons.
<br>* The USB charging port and cable is a different size then my other electronics (the Oontz Angle, my Lenovo tablet). Needing a 3rd USB cable size is a pain.
<br>* Adjusting the volume sometimes turns down the ringer / alarm volume on my iPhone. I use my phone as my alarm clock, so this can be problematic.
<br>* The speaker occasionally resets to full volume when I turn it on &amp; start my audiobook playing from my iPhone.
<br>
<br>If you think any of the above cons may apply to you, then you may want to look elsewhere. If they don't apply, then I think this speaker will work well for you. I hope this helps you decide!",是,3,D. McMillan,2020-10-02

US,B07594HZ6Y,RKB9JTP2ZWWEX,Awesome product that works as advertised.,Color:Black,"I allready had the maxsound plus for a few years and imo its the best in its class. I also bought a bunch for friends and family and everyone loves it. I knew the xsound go was also considered best in its class by many so when i saw they upgraded it with usb c and stereo pairing i had to give it a try.
<br>Imo 2 of these give a more immersive music experience then 1 maxsound plus because you get actual soundstage and awesome clarity. Its a midfocused sound which i like and female vocals sound delicious. The bass is good allthough somewhat laid back but that can easily be adjusted with some eq. The pairing itself works great aswell.
<br>Just press both bluetooth buttons for 5s and they will pair, then you can press the power button on 1 to turn them both off. Next time you turn them both on they will automaticaly pair and say which is left and right. Battery life is great but i think its a little less when used in stereo. By itself its great but i would strongly recommend getting a pair because most music is meant to be heard in stereo.

US,B07594HZ6Y,R1W7GCIDB5IA27,Worked great ... until it didn't,Color:Black,"This is a great little speaker for what I wanted it for -- mostly just for my morning shower/dressing routine. It has great sound, pairs up with the Bluetooth on my Android with no problem, and the battery lasts a long time. So I would have given it five stars ... except that after only a year and a half one of the speakers is going out. I never immersed it in water, just hung it in the shower out of the way of the spray, and also used it on the counter top in the bathroom, occasionally around the house in other places. So I'm pretty disappointed that it gave out so quickly. The shower speaker this replaced was cheaper in many ways, but lasted a lot longer. (At least 2-3 years.)
<br>
<br>I will say I might have docked a half-star (if that were possible) in the beginning because the controls are a little hard to see, and not raised enough to tell in the shower (without my glasses) which one you're pushing. Obviously the Power On button and the Volume Up on the ends are easy to find, but it's hard for me to tell whether I'm touching the Volume Down or the Pause/Skip button, or the Pause/Skip or Pair button, when I'm standing there rinsing my hair and reaching up to skip a song or change the volume -- the buttons aren't raised enough to figure it out very well. That part could have been designed better.
<br>
<br>I'm having to buy a new shower speaker now, and won't go with this one again for that reason (the buttons). Going to try out something that has a better interface that way, maybe a little more powerful. And hopefully the new one will last a lot longer.",是,4,GraceDancer,2020-09-12

Other people that have smaller speakers. I can only hear mine if I’m standing in front of it. One girl’s speaker was so nice and loud that I just turned mine off from disappointment. If you’re only going to listen to it in your quiet room then I guess buy it. But for outdoors and other places I would say it’s not loud enough at all.,否,2,DCD,2020-09-12

Next to the cheaper Surf, the Go sounded lacking in bass and projection. But, I decided to give the Go a few days just listening to that and I now think they are both very good just different. The Surf is a little more bass focused and tighter sounding. The XSound Go has a very wide and balanced sound. You can hear the separation of instruments very well with this. It is a subtle speaker and sounds like a tiny version of an expensive sound system.

<br>Its a good speaker for under $30 price range. The Bluetooth range is not much and definitely not what is advertised. I would say 20-25 ft max.

The Bose speaker is in the $70 price range, and only lasts roughly 4-6 hours. I bought this Tribit as a replacement and it's honestly fantastic. The sound quality is way better than expected. As good as the Bose product but for much cheaper. Tribit gets pretty loud. It could be a little louder, but it definitely does the job. You also dont lose sound quality at high volume. I am extremely happy with this product, especially considering its half the price of similar products. The site says Tribit has a 24 hour battery life. I definitely don't think it's quite that long. But it's easily three or four times better than the Bose speaker. So while I was a bit disappointed with the battery, it's still great.

I have purchased a few over the years but they would either have too much treble or washed out base. This speaker emits crisp highs, balanced mid range and a punchy base. It can literally fill a large sized room with rich, deep sound. I have put the speaker through it's paces by trying several styles of music and every time I'm left slightly shocked on how well it sounds. The build also feels solid with an incredibly fast connection speed to bluetooth.

<br>2- the overall response of this speaker is so good and uniform that the bass does not appear to be obvious.

However, I have some quite decent (Klipsch) subwoofers, which I would expect to decipher and accurately (and deeply) replicate, but this is not that level.

US,B07594HZ6Y,R2PLDPYTHYVEKG,"Awesome loud, light, little waterproof speaker.",Color:Black,"I’m a huge tribit fan and this little speaker packs a punch! It’s light, portable, and waterproof! What’s not to love? So why did I return it? Well, I really liked the sound quality, but I was deciding between this one and the maxsound plus (also by tribit) and I settle in the MaxSound. I tested 3 people in addition to myself and they all said the sound quality of this was amazing, but just not as good as the maxsound, I was torn because i was purchasing a speaker, specifically a waterproof speaker, to take out in a boat, but I also wanted something I could carry with me if I went hiking or to the beach. If I were deciding based on weight alone, this one is by far the better choice. I think there is about a half pound difference in weight. And this thing gets loud! I mean it’s awesome! I suspect it would do well over the sounds of waves and the boat, but it couldn’t sound as deep as the Maxsound plus does when the bass enhancer Was enabled. So I settled for the other. If I hadn’t purchased the two to try next to each other, I would never have known and would have been ignorantly blissful in my decision. So if you want something light that sounds awesome, this is an excellent speaker. If you want something that sounds just a bit more bassy, and don’t mind the extra weight, then go with the maxsound plus. Either way, you’ll be happy. I’m sorry I forgot to take videos of them side by side with music playing to show you guys the difference, and it really depends on what music you like to listen to. If you listen to mainly vocals, then this speaker is awesome, if you listen to drum and bass and you really want the bass, go for the other.",是,4,NC,2020-08-03

<br>Cons of this product: At high volumes the sound quality deteriorates. Additionally, I had difficulty getting this speaker to pair in a timely manner. Once my phone recognized the speaker, it would try to auto pair every time I turned on the speaker and was in the vicinity of it.

The sound quality is great. I can adjust the volume low enough to not disturb others without losing soungd quality.

With a longer shower in the morning and a short one at night after exercising this speaker gets about 40 mins of playtime per day.
<br>
<br>I used it for three days so far and it still shows the battery at 90%. Not bad considering this is a small speaker. Volume is sufficient for the enclosed space but it will certainly not fill a big room. It does not have strong bass which is understandable - it weights about half of my Anker Soundcore Pro+.

US,B07594HZ6Y,R3FXWTKLGJPY1V,Extremely problematic. Dissapointed.,Color:Black,"I bought this speaker as a small desk speaker to use occasionally as a bluetooth speaker, and it hasnt been good straight out the box.
<br>
<br>First of all, when connected to aux, it doesnt automatically detect its connected to aux, so it just keeps searching for Bluetooth. This means if you have it on aux, and try turning it on, it simply wont work, and need to remove and replug the aux in every time.
<br>
<br>Secondly, you cannot use it while its charging. This makes it super inconveniencing for a desk setup, as if you try and use it while its charging, it emits a loud buzzing sound meshed with you actual audio.
<br>
<br>On top of that, I used it with the aux plugged in and it would frequently disconnect and prioritize Bluetooth connection to my phone WHILE THE AUX WAS IN, meaning it disconnected from my audio a LOT.
<br>
<br>Those problems are just the tip of the iceberg, not mentioning how the audio quality it extremely bass heavy and drowns out mid level sounds, so basically you cant even hear the song, just the bumping beat.

<br>
<br> It's utterly foolish that there is no way to tell what is remaining of the battery life and there is no way to tell how far along the charge is.

<br>The controls are black on black with no raised buttons so you have to pick it up and get light on it to see the volume or play/pause buttons.
<br>
<br>If you use it a couple times, the next time you pick it up, you have no idea what is left of the battery and you may be on the golf course or at the pool and get 10 minutes of use before the battery dies.

<br>You plug it in to a charger and you have no clue whether it is 10% charged or 99% charged.

However, I had never used it. While packing up and moving into my new home, I came across it again. I wanted to listen to music while going up and down the stairs unpacking, but did not want to wear my earbuds. Well I easily paired this little Tribit to my Note 9 to listen to some tunes and was blown away. I left this little speaker on my bedroom dresser, went downstairs, and couldn't even tell that I had stepped away from it. It is that powerful and LOUD.

<br>
<br>The biggest complaint I have is that the speaker tends to ""washed out"" with high pitched tones. An example is when someone (man or woman) has a high pitched voice or a bad microphone. Bass seems fine but the overall quality of the audio is degraded.
<br>
<br>I also cannot use the microphone on this for calls as it is not high quality enough. That is not the biggest issue since I can still use the laptop mic in Microsoft Teams and an alternate speaker.

US,B07594HZ6Y,RIGCIV4PCP56C,Bass and Volume aren't nearly as Good as Similarly Priced Competitor's Speaker,Color:Black,"Based on description and reviews, including sound comparisons I listened to on YouTube, I expected ""rich bass"" and ""room-filling"" sound. I didn't expect miracles in this price range but I was surprised to find Tribit falls far short of quoted descriptions when compared to the similarly priced Anker Soundcore Motion B speaker which I received as a birthday/Father's Day gift from my family. I performed a side-by-side comparison of these two competing speakers and the Soundcore Motion B easily outperformed the Tribit XSound Go in both bass and volume. The Tribit also had an annoying flaw of a blast of high volume upon Bluetooth pairing with the source before adjusting back to the actual user level setting. The lanyard on the Tribit offered a minor plus in terms of portability vs. the Soundcore. The only other plus for the Tribit over the Soundcore was a claimed a battery capacity of 4400 mAhr for the Tribit vs. 2600 mAhr for the Soundcore. In practical terms, the Soundcore provided adequate playing time to allow a typical day's use at high volume/max bass before needing a recharge. I didn't determine an actual amount of playing time for the Tribit so I'm assuming it would be longer based on the claimed battery specs. For my preferences, the better sound quality of the Soundcore easily outweighed the higher battery capacity of the Tribit. The Anker Soundcore Motion B also offers the option of True Wireless Stereo (TWS) which would allow a pairing a second Soundcore Motion B speaker for added volume. This option is something I would consider in the future as I could see giving a speaker to my adult son/daughter and we could pair them in TWS mode when we have a family party or vacation together.",是,2,JF,2020-07-08

Plugging in PC speakers to earphone jack did not work, so decided to try blue tooth. The manual was sparse, but everything worked like a charm and the volume was great. Some neat features: when charged, the little red light went out (manual doesn't tell you about the red lite), when you are at max volume with volume button, you get a beep telling you so. Once paired, blue tooth came back on automatically when restarting the Fire, with a confirming beep. And the weight makes you think this is not a cheap plastic device.

When I first got it, I was disappointed when using it to watch video/TV on my tablet as the latency was very high even after applying an update to the speaker. There was a 1 second lag between the video and audio which I blamed on the speaker. It was like this for about a year. Then, out of the blue, the issue was gone. Apparently, an update to my Amazon Fire tablet finally addressed the issue. When placed either on my chest or my pillow behind my head, it really sounds much wider than expected. I hear sounds coming from well beyond the speakers. It's almost holographic. There's also a nice bass thump. Range is very good.

It doesn't get too loud, but it's loud enough to provide clear sound that can be heard easily. There isn't much depth to the sound, as it doesn't have much base, but I didn't buy it expecting an earth shaking deep sound profile. For a low priced portable speaker that can withstand the elements you wont be disappointed. The battery life isn't anything to wow you, but it's not terrible. Easily get several hours of use out of it per charge. The range of the Bluetooth is great and I don't lose connection unless I walk several rooms/feet away - for my phone, I probably get a good 40 feet if not more (estimate). If you're looking for more of an entertainment style speaker with a great sound profile, this isn't for you, but if you just want something simple to play your audio, it's perfect.",是,4,Gippetto,2020-06-23

US,B07594HZ6Y,R19GO8ZAHZZOTB,Doesn't Hold Up Against OontZ Angle 3 Ultra,Color:Black,"I bought the Tribit XSound Go based on the outstanding reviews and after my OontZ Angle 3 Ultra died (due to what I suspect is the deliberately weak USB-B power socket). I was furious with Cambridge Soundworks and in a snit hoped I would find a substitute that would avenge my sense of purchaser outrage over the fact that all Cambridge Soundworks would do is give me a measly 20% discount on a OontZ as the dead one 21 months past the stingy 90 warranty.
<br>
<br>Outrage aside, I bought another OontZ Angle 3 Ultra for comparison and switched back and forth between it and the Tribit on the same song. There is no comparison. The Tribit may have a very slight advantage in clarity but for bass and power the OontZ is far and away a better speaker. I got a $3 discount on the Tribit so it's price was only $29.99 before taxes but the Oontz is easily worth the extra five or six bucks.
<br>
<br>As small speakers go, the Tribit isn't a bad one, especially for the price. However, it doesn't compare to the rich bass and power of the OontZ.

Most of the rest of my kit is of the insufferable audiophile nerd variety, but this little guy punches way above his weight, and the price is beyond right.

US,B07594HZ6Y,RJQMX7ZEIR3G1,Sound cuts out during silent periods; dialogue interrupted.,Color:Black,"It seems that during even brief periods of audio silence the unit enters a sleep mode to conserve battery energy. When input resumes it does not start up quickly enough, which causes interruption of playback, particularly while listening to human speech. Because of this behavior, this Bluetooth speaker was useless for listening to a podcast.
<br>Also, without audio input it shuts down completely after only a short while, forcing me to repetitively turn it back on.
<br>The only good thing about this product is the sound quality. It is very good, the best I've heard from a small speaker. It would serve well for listening to music that does not have silent moments.",是,2,qed,2020-06-13

The speaker has been so great that I still haven't felt motivated to fix my car speakers.
<br>Their customer service is also awesome. The charging port of the speaker got a little touchy (the cord had to be in JUST the right spot to charge), and (because I was within my 18 month warranty) they sent me a new one, no hassle at all. Just a quick email and confirmation of my new address.

The mushy sound on the Echo Dot is now gorgeous. It will play plugged in or by its own battery.

I read some reviews and looked at the dimensions online, but I was still suprized at how small it was. I placed a pen in front of it in the picture to supply some perspective on its size. I was debating whether I should get the more expensive Max Sound. For my use, I thought this would be best. I was right! I first used it inside, and I was amazed at the clarity and crispness. My wife was three rooms away, and she told me to turn it down. I took it outside to do yard work, and it was more that adequate as I moved 50 feet away. It cranks! Super portable and seems very sturdy.",是,5,Tom,2020-06-01
US,B07594HZ6Y,R2WFG7Q15FB8FN,Great sound and lasts!,Color:Black,"I love this speaker so much! I’ve had this for almost a full year now, and I use it all the time. I bought it specifically for work because we can listen to music in the back or after we close, and I was tired of the small quiet speakers my coworkers had. I wanted to give it a try. This speaker can get so loud and the sound is so clear, it’s fantastic! Any bass notes are pretty prominent as well! When I’m closing in the back in dish, I’ll be there for about 6 hours and the battery lasts the whole time. I typically charge it every night after every use anyway, but the battery lasts a long time. The only thing is that the Bluetooth may take a few seconds but that’s it! It will connect to whoever used it last first. So keep that in mind if someone else uses it and they’re right next to you, but you’re the one who wants to connect to it. Otherwise, fantastic speaker!",是,5,Amazon Customer,2020-06-01
US,B07594HZ6Y,R311NNZ0FABH5R,Sound is fine. Constant high pitched whine and static are not.,Color:Black,"&nbsp;Bought this based on all the glowing reviews. The sound is fine for a small unit. I haven't owned a lot of Bluetooth speakers so I can't really compare but coming from an audio production background it's about what I'd expect from a consumer-grade bluetooth box. Decent clarity, decent bass, decent volume. Doesn't wow me. For $30, it's fine.
<br>
<br>What DOES bother me is the high-pitched whine and intermittent static this thing constantly produces when it's connected to *both* a 3.5mm input cable and the USB charging cable (see video w/sound on). With just one or the other, it's silent, but if you try to use both (I'm using it at my workstation receiving audio from my computer so this is how it will be used 99.9% of the time for me) it makes an awful racket that's very annoying and distracts from whatever I'm listening to. Forget about enjoying music or games with quiet or silent sections. Turning the volume up to hear the music/sound better just makes it worse as the noise also gets louder with volume.
<br>
<br>I've used this same setup/cables with other powered speaker devices that have not had this issue, so I have to believe it's the device.
<br>
<br>Maybe I got a bad one but at this point I couldn't recommend this.",是,2,M.B. Smith,2020-06-01

Out of all the portable options this one is the only one that has lasted. It works as well now as it did the first day. We have taking it out in the rain and put it in the shower. We own two tribit products, this one and bluetooth earbuds. The earbuds still work. Well, one of them works. I was in an accident on my skateboard and the other flew off. i couldn't find it after I fell. The other one is still going strong. I have to say I am thoroughly impressed by the durability. In a disposable society it's great to know that there are companies that worry about quality. Both products were purchased around the same time. My other bluetooth headsets from Anker, thought I loved the design, have crapped out on me. Anker has great customer support but with Tribit I didn't need to contact customer support. Wait, that's not true, in the very beginning I remember that I had a problem with the audio being out of sync with that early batch of speakers. I contacted them and they gave me an update for the firmware. It cleared the problem up right away. Things should just work as intended and they have products that exceeded my expectations.
<br>
<br>Another note on longevity of the company. I bought another pair of earbuds that was really highly rated on Amazon from a company I never heard of and , recently, I have been having problems with one side. The company is no longer on Amazon so there goes my warranty. A lot of companies sell a huge batch of products but don't stay to support them.

<br>5.The sound quality is very good, compared to my OOntz angle 3 ultra, which has a clean sound but no bass. This speaker, tribit, has great bass, feel the bass beat, clean and no resonance, not like the fake bass from the oontz.
<br>
<br>The volume is perfect for your room, study or living room, hey it's not for parties.
<br>
<br>Listen to Metallica, Guns and Roses, Bach, Pop, etc. and it is very balanced, it is a pleasure to listen to your music.
<br>6. I use a ""Bass Booster app"" equalizer, I only increased the bass by 20%, the rest in normal and it improves the sound even more, it is incredible.
<br>
<br>I will be updating my experience as I accumulate hours of use, but at the moment it is my main speaker, and I do not imagine, the sound of the other tribits that sound even better ... impressive Tribit!",是,5,Juan L. Deaza,2020-05-19

Well worth $30 but the speaker is limited in volume and depth of sound to fill a room. This speaker is not the equivalent of the Bose, UE, or Sonos top of the line Bluetooth speakers but better than most speakers in the $20 to $50 range.

I can force it to happen by lowering the audio to a barely audible whisper. Initially, it will play but after a moment the audio completely cuts off. Researching online, I've found that people either think it's a noise filtering defect or a result of aggressive battery saving.
<br>
<br>Of course I'm not going to listen to whisper quiet audio, but there are moments in music, movies, and games where the audio level will drop and it's annoying to miss sections of audio because this speaker keeps cutting on and off.

US,B07594HZ6Y,R17AW5K08SE8K6,Big Bang for the Buck,Color:Black,"First of all, I'm a real deal recovered audiophile. Now, I never ever expected to find true audiophile sound from a little Bluetooth speaker any more than I would from a clock radio, car stereo, or boombox. And as it is, this doesn't deliver audiophile sound either. That's not necessarily a bad thing, though. You just can't get that audiophile sound for under $50 anywhere. No, no, you'd need separate power amps (preferably tubes) and a preamp and source components coupled to decent speakers and using respectable quality cables and interconnects.
<br>Alas, I can't fall to sleep very well. At bedtime I've always got certain tracks playing on an all night playlist. Damn if I don't wake up at least once to have a late night pee. Getting back to sleep after that is impossible without some soothing voices. I have an iphone 8 which has respectable sound quality for a phone, but there is no appreciable bass or vocal quality. Now, thanks to this Tribit I can have that. Also, being a teacher I've been relegated to daily Zoom meetings due to the Covid-19 outbreak. With the Tribit, I can bypass the phone or laptop speakers and actually be able to hear! As it is, I never bothered with external speakers for the laptop bc it sits on an antique desk and I want as little tech stuff as possible on it.
<br>
<br>In short, this is an excellent value. Sure, I probably would get more dynamics and projection from a JBL or Bose, but I'd also have paid at least 4 times the price. I don't really even listen to jazz, but it's raining outside and for some reason I decided to try out Dave Brubeck's ""Take Five"" for the first song played. I'm sitting about 6 feet away and of course I can't discern true stereo imaging or separation from tiny speakers only inches apart, but I'll tell you what . . . that alto sax doesn't mingle with the piano either. Not a bad little deal.",是,5,Frankland S. Strickland,2020-05-17

The Bluetooth connectivity is quite simple and easy with no issues so far. Now talking about the sound, the simplest way to put it is basically you are getting what you paid for. In no way is this an AMAZING speaker but of course, you wouldn't or at least shouldn't expect that from a $30 speaker. With that being said, the sound quality is pretty good. Bases are TOO prominent but the treble is fine. However, the speaker does have that scratchy background noise which isn't too noticeable but still can hear it if you try to. The build quality is actually quite surprising, it feels like a premium portable Bluetooth speaker.

US,B07594HZ6Y,R2BWCWV7CLBWFD,"Tried 8 speakers, kept 3. This was one of them.",Color:Black,"Here's the speakers I tried:
<br>
<br>Tribit XSound Go (kept it and love it, for listening inside in a quiet room).
<br>
<br>Logitech Roll 2 (Kept it, only use it for listening to videos because the other speakers I liked better for sound, but they have an audio delay when watching videos).
<br>
<br>Oontz Angle 3 Ultra - I thought it sounded muddy. Returned it.
<br>
<br>Aomais Go-Jr - pretty good sound but it wasn't quite loud enough for what I wanted it for (listening outside). Returned it.
<br>
<br>Aomais U-go - I thought the sound was better on the Go-Jr even though the battery is better on the U-Go. They weren't too different though, and neither was loud enough for me for outdoor listening. Returned it.
<br>
<br>Anker Soundcore Motion+. The sound quality on this thing was awesome, and volume was very good for its size. I like that it can be paired with another in stereo. It looks and feels high quality. I'd have kept this one for indoor listening over the Tribit if price was no object. I'd have kept it for outdoor listening if I wanted my solution to be compact. However, my priority was high volume high quality sound, and for that, the W-King D8 beat the Anker by quite a margin.
<br>
<br>Alpatronix ""60W"" speaker that looks identical to the W-King D8. They advertise it as ""updated"" from 40W to 60W. I don't buy it. To me, the D8 was clearly louder and had better sound at the higher volumes.
<br>
<br>Finally, the one I kept and love: W-king D8. IMO, it looks like crap. Its big, heavy, and cheap looking, and has a big ugly W-KING written on it. But the sound knocks the socks off everything else I tried. I use it outdoors for hosting little dance parties, and I also listen to it indoors. At low volumes I think it's a bit bass heavy, but the bass drops off to an even level at volumes 50% and above. Indoors I listen to it around 60%. Outdoors around 90%. I like that this thing doesn't live in max volume, like my other speakers do. A good sign. I bought a second one and they paired well with each other. The sound is amazing, rich full, loud. Batterly life isn't super great. I only get maybe 4 hours or so at high volumes.",是,5,Another east bay knight,2020-05-15

It was easy to pair and fit nicely on a table next to me. However, after 30 minutes of inactivity, it shuts itself off, and you have to push the power button to get it to come on again. This would make sense if it were on battery power, but it does it even if it is plugged into USB for power. I searched the Amazon reviews and questions, and found a company rep mention that auto-off is disabled if the unit has something plugged into the 1/8"" line jack. I plugged in my headphones (it's not a headphone jack; it's meant for audio coming in from a computer or TV or something using a male-male 1/8"" cable). It worked! You may need to go into Bluetooth and reselect it as the device, since it thinks it should disconnect from Bluetooth when you plug in an audio source.

When I try to turn it back on, red light flashes again and it turns off. I have reset it and tried pairing it to different bluetooth devices to no avail.

US,B07594HZ6Y,R5ZRQMA6HL9CV,Best Bluetooth Speaker for the price,Color:Black,"I bought the Tribit XSound Go Bluetooth Speaker after trying a couple of other speakers as a replacement/substitute speaker for my 2015 HP 13"" Spectre Laptop computer. [My HP 13"" Spectre Laptop computer internal speaker stopped working after 4 1/2 years. HP told me it would cost me north of $500.00 plus about a month in their shop to get it fixed]. I decided to use the Bluetooth capability built into the laptop to drive an external Bluetooth speaker to provide me with the sound I often need when using my computer. The Tribit XSound Go Bluetooth Speaker fit my need very well. Not only does it sound 200% + better than the previously built-in HP laptop speaker, it works anywhere in my house due the the long range of the Bluetooth signal and the long battey life. The Tribit XSound Go Bluetooth Speaker is one of two other speakers by different manufactures I've tried and I settled for it because of it superior sound, battery life, and ease to set-up.
<br>
<br>Additionally, the people at Tribit who provides customer services were great after I reported a slight issues I had with the first XSound Go Bluetooth Speaker. Their services were so impeccable and after a few suggestions to try to resolve the issues (via e-Mail), they decided to ship me a brand new Tribit XSound Go Bluetooth Speaker. With the ease of installation I'm now good to go. I love the speaker for its looks, size, and customer service. I highly recommend this speaker to anyone interested in spending a small amount of money for a superb Bluetooth speaker. Tribit is the way to go for great value for your money. Thus, I score it 5 STARs on all counts.",是,5,AnilR,2020-03-07

US,B07594HZ6Y,R1KJEE5OOQCKLK,Great ... But Only While It Lasted,Color:Black,"The speaker was great ... nice sound output, flexible in use/range. Unfortunately, for such a supposedly well made speaker, it started having sound issues two months ago. When listening through the speaker (via bluetooth on my MAC), the sound seems like it's at a speed a tad faster than it should be (???), so when listening to my podcasts while working, all speech sounds abrupt/choppy and it's very hard to keep track of what's being said. When I play the podcast just through my MAC, the sound and speed is flawless. When I play other podcasts or You Tube videos through my MAC, no problem at all. When others connect their devices to my MAC via bluetooth, there is no problem with sound. The sound issue belongs completely to this Tribit speaker. And, to boot, I've only ever used this speaker indoors (not outside, not near water, etc) and only within the speaker's range on my first floor. So, what was a great speaker has stopped working which is very disappointing and a complete waste of money. I won't purchase a Tribit product again. I should start looking for another speaker elsewhere. And, mind you, this speaker was rated very highly, and yet, here I am, out of a speaker and my money.",是,2,Jeanne Ortiz,2020-03-02

I need Bluetooth connectivity and portable size. I tested six products and this review covers them all. None were truly great.
<br>
<br>Emacros wireless conference speakerphone had a nice sound coming from the speaker. Voices coming over the phone sounded good too. However, there was an echo. The person calling in to the speaker hears their own voice coming back to them, not all the time but enough to disqualify this one. Sometimes just a ""wah wah"" and sometimes clear entire words.
<br>
<br>Skywin wireless conference call speaker and microphone just sounded bad. It clipped off the ends of all the words spoken near it.
<br>
<br>Bose SoundLink revolve sadly did not match it's price. There was an echo similar to Emacros, though not as bad. The volume coming out of the speaker could not be turned up high enough on phone. There was a background hissing.
<br>
<br>The long shot cheaper Trinity Xsound Go wireless Bluetooth speaker had such a loud background hissing that we didn't test it much.
<br>
<br>Finally the one we kept- miniJambox by Jawbone. If you hold it like a cell phone with the mic on the top, it doesn't echo so bad as the others. Voices were clear on each end of the call. Volume was good. Sound quality was not great but better than cell phone. It was only $35.",是,3,Amazon Customer,2020-03-01

I was able to use it right out of the box. I played Halsey’s Manic album all the way through twice. I used it on the kitchen counter while cleaning.

It looks durable and sleek - doesn’t look cheap at all. Really glad to have gotten this quality at this price.
<br>
<br>Additional notes:
<br>- This product feels heavier than I expected. Not so heavy that it’s inconvenient, in my opinion. But I did wonder if my shower hook (one of those vacuum suction cups) would be able to carry it. It did.
<br>- No rewind or fast forward buttons. This is done by two and three presses on the play button. This isn’t unusual - my AirPods work that way as well as the accessibility shortcuts on my iPhone.

I was pleasantly surprised by how heavy it was when I got it all unwrapped and unboxed. I'm old, so I still subscribe to the idea that if it's heavy, (it doesn't matter what ""it"" is) it's either expensive or of fine quality or both. Well the Tribit certainly wasn't expensive. My last Bluetooth speaker was very inexpensive, the sound was mediocre at best and it finally gave up the ghost by refusing to charge. I surmised that the repair charge would be more than it was worth so now I have a small white paperweight.
<br>The Tribit is the replacement and there is no comparison. Stunning sound from such a small device and just the right amount of bass. I suppose well balanced would be the words to use. It is definitely of fine quality.

If you are just looking to fill a single room with ample volume and quality fidelity, this is the speaker for you. On the other hand, if you are looking to fill a huge space or to annoy your neighbors when in the backyard, this may not be the speaker for you.

The Earfun company was started by some of the people who were at Tribit, so their speakers are very similar in sound, design and quality. Both the older Tribit XSound Go and newer Earfun Go feature dual drivers and a single passive radiator in the middle. Both are IPX7 rated, 12w total power, 24 hour battery life rated and are nearly the same size. The differences are the Tribit uses older 4.2 Bluetooth and micro-USB to charge, while the Earfun uses the newest Bluetooth 5.0 and USB-C to charge. And the biggest difference, at least in my opinion, is the Earfun Go allows for two speakers to be paired wirelessly in TWS (true wireless stereo) mode, while the Tribit XSound Go has no TWS capability. The Earfun Go often goes on sale for $20 or even less. I see absolutely no reason to buy the Tribit XSound Go when the Earfun Go is cheaper, more updated, TWS capable and sounds just as good or better.",否,3,HLA,2020-02-18

<br>
<br>The battery life is great, it lasted 17 hours at 40% of volume, which is nothing bad.
<br>
<br>It's waterproof (IPX7), which allows me to use this speaker when I'm taking a shower without worrying about if it messed up.
<br>
<br>It connects very fast to my devices and has sound effects to each action of interaction with the device, like many other Bluetooth speakers.
<br>
<br>The brand offers a warranty period extended ,when you register this product and other of the brand, having finally up to a 18 month raplacement period and a 30-day money back guarantee. Which is very good and makes me want to buy more different products of the same brand.
<br>
<br>If I had to mention the negative aspects of this device (which are minor) I would say that the speakers has a little of lag when I play a song on my phone and the speakers starts sounding.
<br>
<br>And another minor detail is that it doesn't comes up with a aux cable which I like to improve sound quality and avoiding lag. But at this price point it's very easy to understand.
<br>
<br>In conclusion, this is a great device for the price. I got mine at $16 which is crazy. I would like to try the MaxSound Plus which seems to be lot better.
