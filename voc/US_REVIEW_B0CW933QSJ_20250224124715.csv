US,B0CW933QSJ,R3CR0L1HHL4A1T,Great sound,,Great sound. Have now bought two and everyone in the family takes it and uses it everywhere from the shower to camping. Nice compact size and battery lasts a long time.,是,5,Natalie Peterson,2025-02-08
US,B0CW933QSJ,R21KGRG1Z3F224,Great little speaker,,"Solidly built. It's sturdy, but compact. I think it's a good value, especially when on sale. Bluetooth connection was easy. Sound is great considering the size. We use it when we're out in the pool and it's loud enough to her over the noise. It's waterproof, so we don't have to worry if it starts to rain or if it gets splashed. Battery life is good, we haven't had it go out on us on a pool day yet.",否,5,J&S,2025-02-06

US,B0CW933QSJ,R2INKB0KT3NRWW,Awesome Speaker,,I use my speaker to listen to music and the sound is incredible. I also use it when I talk on the my cell phone. It is a great thing to have for seniors who have trouble hearing some phone conversations. It is easy to charge. A perfect size Easy to connect with Bluetooth. I did it myself and I’m 80.,是,5,Julie S,2025-01-21
US,B0CW933QSJ,R23LGTLESW140K,Good bass and sound,,My wife complains its too loud. We have the storm blast too and that shakes the house but this is a good middle ground. Charge lasts a long time as well. I like more bass and this could have a little more but great for its size.,是,5,Link conger,2025-01-19

US,B0CW933QSJ,R20XWZKH2PJRLK,Superb,,"I've always liked the original version of this speaker I purchased 6+ year s ago (back when Tribit called it the ""XBoom""), so when I decided I wanted to add another Bluetooth speaker (without spending a fortune), this seemed like an obvious choice. Most reviews say the ""Rev 2"" is even better than the original, and I agree! Sound is crisp and clean, bass is adequate without the ""bass boost"" feature. Highly recommend!",是,5,RF456,2025-01-17
US,B0CW933QSJ,R4PHI533GAF2T,Excellant sound quality,,"This is the opinion of the audiophiles in the family who have musical degrees. We were very pleasantly surprised that it exceeded expectations.

US,B0CW933QSJ,R9XTC03628VCW,Wow!!,,"I bought this speaker on sale expecting it to be your run of the mill Bluetooth speaker, you know sounds ok, not great, need something for the beach, fishing camping etc. How surprised was I when I charged it up and connected my phone to it and the sounds coming out. It sounded great in my kitchen, I took it outside into my garage and worked outside for a few hours and I adjusted the volume and even my neighbor come over to say the speaker sounded great. Great purchase, you can sync two of these together for stereo sound and they are water resistant and dust proof so they can go with you wherever. I have taken mine fishing, camping, on picnics and have dropped it and it plays great for a long while. If your not driving it at loud volumes, it will last all day and sound great. This speaker is a great deal for the sound and durability you get.",是,5,Rainman,2025-01-12

US,B0CW933QSJ,R1HGZ0J5QV26V2,Amazing!,,"Sound quality + bass! I enjoy Christian music and light rock, I cannot ask for more across the spectrum.

US,B0CW933QSJ,R38C6K14FO0L5T,Worth the price,,"Overall, I’m very pleased with the sound quality of these speakers, I purchased two to pair for stereo use. The pairing and connectivity to Bluetooth were very easy. The EQ app really allows you to adjust the audio to your liking, especially for the low end. With a little tweaking you can get more base than the base boost setting. I love the portability of these speakers, truly great sound on the go!",是,5,Randall,2024-12-10

US,B0CW933QSJ,R2TGDDVJTSG2DN,Loud!,,Great speaker! Custom EQ settings in the Tribit app really take this speaker to another level! Using it on my neighborhood cruising golf cart. May get another one to go full stereo and really embarrass my kids with my song choices!,是,5,USA,2024-11-13

US,B0CW933QSJ,RAOBA2T2T1NG5,Audio delay when using the 3.5mm aux input,,"Nice sounding unit but there is a noticeable delay when plugging into the 3.5mm aux input. I confirmed it is the speaker by trying another cable, source and finally another speaker with a 3.5mm aux input.
<br>
<br>If you’ll only use it with Bluetooth it’ll be fine. Aux input, you’re sunk",是,2,Cat Kim,2024-10-26
US,B0CW933QSJ,R137C2DX1OOYVE,Amazing speaker!,,"I watched plentyyy of YouTube comparison videos before deciding to purchase—Tribit definitely had amazing reviews and held up to speakers like JBL, so I decided to try it out.
<br>
<br>But which Tribit to buy? Should I go with 360 sound or something more directional?
<br>
<br>In many video comparisons, 360 had an “airy” sound that I was slightly hesitant about but I decided to go with it because I sometimes have people over, plus I may move around in a room quite a bit while listening alone.
<br>
<br>I was NOT disappointed! The sound is excellent and I highly recommend",是,5,Charlotte,2024-10-22

US,B0CW933QSJ,R1B2H793TTOXCC,"Powerful Sound, Less Cost",,"I found this product searching for the best rated Bluetooth speakers and this brand was recommended. Compared to the excellent but very expensive JBL, this speaker is a superior choice. I lost my JBL and purchased this speaker as a replacement - it exceeds my expectations. Great, rich sound in all directions, long lasting battery, very loud, cool app for smartphone. It seems to like being charged by a computer USB as opposed to a wall charger and will play while being charged. Great value. Highly recommended.",是,5,98Dawg,2024-09-09

US,B0CW933QSJ,R1C6FPV3IXZLBC,"Very good, bassy sound!",,"The speaker itself sounds very good, and even has a button that lets you add extra bass to it! I, however, have found issues with it fighting between the AUX input for my computer and the bluetooth on my phone. Sometimes I'll be playing something on my computer and my phone audio starts to play for no reason.

US,B0CW933QSJ,RJVN6OAOLSM71,Excellent Quality,,For the size of the product the sound is very good and takes up minimal space. I do enjoy using it outdoors and inside. Not designed to be left in rain or wet environment but can be used outdoors with proper care. Very easy to use.,是,5,Love My 55,2024-08-28
US,B0CW933QSJ,RJSM1DHEFD3SW,"Solid sound, not perfect",,"Improved sound over original Tribit Stormbox
<br>
<br>Solid bass performance, mids a bit too recessed
<br>
<br>Highs are a bit brittle and can be slightly harsh
<br>
<br>Overall, solid speaker when on sale around $40, built quality is outstanding and easy to use
<br>
<br>Compared to JBL charge and flip, this Stormbox2 holds its own, but lacks midrange and treble clarity of the JBLs, but at a better price point. Lacks clarity and sound quality of Tribit maxsound and xsound speakers though.",是,4,Dr. Ace Farley,2024-08-27
US,B0CW933QSJ,RJTBJ7MJKDBIZ,Super impressed!,,"I wanted a little speaker for the beach so I thought I'd try this and it did not disappoint! Great battery life,, great sound, buttons are soft and fun to push. Also great size!",否,5,Chilly,2024-08-24

US,B0CW933QSJ,R22BVEJX99800L,"Solid Speaker, Especially For The Price",,"For $69+, you will not go wrong with the Tribit Stormbox 2. I paid for this with my own money. The sound quality for a $69 speaker is excellent. It gets loud with the 34 watts, loud enough to be heard just fine over a group of drunks. It has the latest Bluetooth 5.3 and connects fast. There is a ""bass booster"" button that does audibly bump up the bass-- look for $69 you aren't gonna get some deep bumping beats. But it's good enough. You can connect to the app and customize the sound settings. It's IPX7 so it will probably be fine if you drop it in the pool. And they claim the battery lasts 24 hours, I'm assuming this is at mid volume and the bass booster off. Bottom line, it would be hard if not impossible to find a louder, better sounding speaker at this price point. Plus it's waterproof and has a great battery.",是,5,Andrew R,2024-08-06
US,B0CW933QSJ,R1Q62U008MLL6S,Good product,,Good value for money.,是,5,Hemant P. Bhanushali,2024-08-02
US,B0CW933QSJ,R32CMA34J8LVK9,The Sound is Amazing!,,The media could not be loaded.     The sound quality is amazing especially when riding around town on my e-bike. It fits perfectly inside the drink holder on my Evi bike allowing me to hear music while riding. It’s safer than headphones because you can still hear what’s going on around you while riding.,是,5,CJ SMITH,2024-08-01
US,B0CW933QSJ,R16PVFDWAZ7TVW,Nice Outdoor Speaker,,"I really like the speaker, it has nice sound. Love that it is water and dust proof. I wish the bass was a little deeper, but it is fine for most music.
<br>
<br>I did find that if I mounted the speaker between the handlebars of my bicycle, it interrupted the signal to my bike's wireless computer (speedometer/odometer). So I needed to mount the speaker is elsewhere on my bike.",是,4,Paul Hagstrom,2024-08-01
US,B0CW933QSJ,R166IUO1CE95UM,Mixed Results; Bike Water Bottle Holder Friendly!,,"The good: The overall construction of the product is amazing. You can tell that it is very tough. I've rode my bike through the rain with this speaker on over an hour without any issues with performance, and it still looks brand new. The mesh cloth is very durable coming in and out of the water bottle cage and feels like it'll last a long time. The product is very heavy which I regard as a positive in terms of durability.
<br>
<br>I like the simplicity of the controls. You can skip songs simply by double clicking the middle circle button so it's easy to use while riding a bike without getting distracted. This was a definite advantage of this unit over others I looked at.
<br>
<br>The bad: Within just a few uses the strap that you use to pull the speaker in and out of position snapped off. It is held together by a very flimsy button. This part is critical for getting the speaker in and out of the side of your backpack, a bike, water bottle, cage or wherever else you use to store it and was one one of the key reasons why I bought the product.
<br>
<br>I wish they would have designed it with only one passive subwoofer portion coming out of the top. When you're using the speaker outdoors, you lose a 50-60% of the bass unless the speaker is sitting on a perfectly hard surface, (This is a really poor design decision since speakers like these are mostly used outdoors while biking, hiking, going to the beach, etc. Where the speaker is often not used on a perfectly flat surface.). In contrast, when I bring the speaker indoors and use it on my office desk, the bass is overwhelming.
<br>
<br>A simple design change to include only one passive woofer on top would have resolved much ofthis issue and yielded a better quality product in my opinion.
<br>
<br>The audio is a little bit ""tin-y"" compared to a Cambridge angle speaker I purchased for about half the price and half the wattage from 3 or 4 years ago. But the bass performs better on this unit (indoors) and this works much better in a water bottle cage on a bicycle. It also has USB-C which my old speaker did not. If you're like me and can't stand carrying around two kinds of cables, USB-C is a must.
<br>
<br>Overall I would give this 3 and 1/2 stars. For the price I was expecting a little bit higher quality sound, but given how perfectly it fits onto my bike, I'm happy.",是,3,Ryan C.,2024-07-31
US,B0CW933QSJ,R24DS8OMQZA09Y,Best of a Crowded Field,,"I've tried about 5 different brand makers of bluetooth speakers, and this very reasonably priced TriBit StormBox 2 has incredible sound, extremely long battery life, and great fidelity.",是,5,Steve of Colorado,2024-07-30
US,B0CW933QSJ,R2MPQSC697O317,Has great sound no matter what it is playing,,"This Bluetooth speaker has very nice sound quality. This is thin enough for me to hang it on my freezer door so that I can hear the music through the apartment. The sound volume is on one side and the on/off and base is on the other. If you have it playing loudly, it can shake what it is sitting on. I will say that I have been told a time or two to turn it down. This speaker will also hook up to the television set. What I like to use it for is taking it down to the pool so I can leave my phone in the apartment and just bring out my speaker. It has a long range before it begins cutting out due to connectivity.",否,5,GetStitched,2024-07-27
US,B0CW933QSJ,R3DDLKUN2AV0GF,Second Stormbox owned,,Loved my first Tribit Stormbox speaker and lost it but this one rocks too. I have several different types and the sound on this one blows all of my other ones away for the size and price. Even my JBL speakers. If I can pair and play 2 at once these will be the best in my opinion. Making this summer the best!! Only issue is pairing it with my phone but I think it's my phone's problem.,是,4,Laura,2024-07-25
US,B0CW933QSJ,RI2GM28G8ANK2,"Sound is great, BT connection is kind of frustrating",,"I had the earlier version of the stormbox and the BT connection was pretty much bullet-proof. I gave that one to my son and bought this Stormbox2 thinking it would be the same only with some improved sound. They both sound great, but the new seems to lose the BT connection and does't reconnect as easily. The old one would just reconnect flawlessly every time I turned it off and on. The SB2 sometimes just reconnects, but mostly disconnects and is a pain to get it reconnected. It like to connect for calls only and not for music. My BT settings are set for both, but it usually takes 2 or 3 times for it to connect for music. that is really why you buy a speaker. I've only had it a few days so maybe it will pan out as I use it, but it is kind of frustrating as of now......",是,3,tdub88,2024-07-19
US,B0CW933QSJ,R1S41FKHJXXPLN,Not as loud as I had hoped,,"Using this at home while doing house work, it is loud enough for my small home but it left me wanting more power. I think my little 10w has more power than this does even at a full charge.",否,4,Lucien Leveille,2024-07-17
US,B0CW933QSJ,R27S1XK54TSK15,Decent sound quality for a budget speaker.,,"I got this speaker to take with me on my work trips. The build quality is pretty good. It’s pretty sturdy as well. I have dropped it a few times and it is still working great. The first time I played it I was pleasantly surprised by how good it sounds for a small budget friendly bluetooth speaker. It has pretty clear and clean sound for what it is. It also has decent bass for a small speaker, but don’t expect for it to blow you away or anything. It’s the perfect size for travel. It also fits perfectly in my tech backpack without taking up too much space. The battery life is decent. So far I have been really enjoying my new speaker. It has become my new travel work speaker. I would definitely recommend it if you’re in the market for a good small budget friendly travel speaker.",否,5,LOOSE SCREWZZ &VIEWS,2024-07-14
US,B0CW933QSJ,RBBITMC0NPDBV,Good value for Money,,Great sound for the size of the unit and excellent performance. Battery lasts for hours. I haven't exactly measured it but have been using it for several days without a recharge.,是,5,S. Seelam,2024-07-09
US,B0CW933QSJ,RZFKT8T2HX1FZ,Powerful little Speaker,,"The package for these speakers arrived on time and in great condition. The speaker itself is really amazing, especially for the 360 surround sound and I have two of these now. I am very surprised how powerful these speakers are and this is my introduction to Tribit and I really love this company. I also have now 2 Tribit StormBox Blast but that is a separate review. It is a little bit a same that from a decent distance at 50% volume with or without the XBass outside that it is very quiet but when it is at max it is very impressive. I tested these inside and compared them to two of my JBL Charge 5's at 50% and max volume while the Tribit was at 50% or less and they blew them out of the water and I was watching and testing movies with it. Far distance at half or max volume outside still goes to JBL but the Tribit StormBox 2 I still really love and they do pack a punch. The connectivity and portability are amazing and are easy to use. The battery life is also good but like most speakers be sure not to go above 50 volume if you want the best unless you have these plugged in.",是,5,"Terry Wilkerson, Jr.",2024-07-08
US,B0CW933QSJ,R3P7M1K97BXOA1,"Like Mickey D's, I'm Loving It",,I got this to stream soft music during open houses.

US,B0CW933QSJ,R3KPON08BQFLDD,Great value for the money,,"Loving this portable Bluetooth speaker system with its powerful bass and long lasting battery. The high quality hardware rivals any of the name brands out there including JVC, LG, and Bose. I had no issues pairing it with multiple sources like my phone, laptop, and desktop PC. The sound seems muffled out of the box, so you really need to install the mobile app to customize the EQ levels to maximize its full potential. Don't even bother with the EQ presets as they're only slightly better than the default setting.",否,5,SIGARM,2024-07-03
US,B0CW933QSJ,R2TRDT8V42FTNN,Fantastic indoor/outdoor speaker. Big sound from a little speaker! It’s really nice!,,"The media could not be loaded.     The Tribit Stormbox 2 is a simply great speaker. The speaker has 360 degree sound with built in subwoofers on each end. The sound is fantastic. It charges fast and will last for 24 hours of playtime. It’s also IXP7 waterproof - so it works indoors or outdoors. It has a nice little strap at the top, great Bluetooth connection, stereo pairing and you can download an app to customize your sound preference. Music is really important at my house - we have 2 family member musicians that live, breathe, eat, sleep and probably dream music. The Tribit is perfect for us to use here at home or take adventuring on a camping trip, etc. We absolutely love the big sound that comes from this little speaker. I hope it works out just as well for you!",否,5,Deb Mericle,2024-06-28
US,B0CW933QSJ,R37MIS7S7JXOKW,Perfect Outdoor Companion - Excellent Sound!,,"This speaker is high-quality and has become my go-to for outdoor gatherings. The surround sound is immersive, delivering clear and powerful audio that fills the space beautifully. The XBass technology adds a rich depth to the music, making every beat more enjoyable. With a 24-hour playtime, I can enjoy music all day without worrying about recharging. It's waterproof and the TWS pairing feature allows me to connect two speakers for an even more impressive sound experience. It is compact, lightweight, and doesn't take up a lot of space when traveling. This speaker excels in performance and durability, making it perfect for any outdoor activity.",否,5,vervepipe,2024-06-23
US,B0CW933QSJ,R641BDRW4KE13,Great Speaker for Inside or Outside,,"This is a waterproof bluetooth speaker. It's about the size of a tall can of soda, but the sound quality is great! It was easy to connect to my Android phone via Bluetooth. The bass on each end is nice. It's fun to watch them go in and out and you can really hear the difference when the bass is turned on or off.
<br>
<br>The sound quality is much, much better than the older Bluetooth speaker we were using. The outside of the speaker is a cloth material, which is wipable. I was disappointed when my toddler grabbed it with peanut butter on her hand, but I was able to wipe it all off. I'd definitely recommend this speaker!",否,5,SF,2024-06-23

US,B0CW933QSJ,R23I8ODHLY39L3,I'm picky about bluetooth speakers and this one is great - full review inside,,"I’m a bit of a bluetooth speaker snob - and really was surprised by this little guy. I really like it.
<br>For this review, I wanted to compare it to something similar both in size and capability.
<br>First I tested it against the Bang &amp; Olufsen Beosound A1 Gen 2. While it compares favorably, it’s clearly outmatched by the B&amp;O. The Tribit Stormbox 2 is LOUDER - but at 6x the cost, the B&amp;O sounds better overall, quite obviously.
<br>Secondly I tested it against a JBL Charge 4. Probably 2.5x as large, and 3x the cost for the current version. This was much closer than the B&amp;O, but the Tribit was still outmatched.
<br>Lastly I tested it against the JBL Go 3 - the JBL is significantly smaller but basically the same price as the Tribit Storm 2. (Spoiler - the Tribit beats the JBL handily.) The JBL has been my portable go-to speaker for a long time, so this is a little surprising.
<br>
<br>I really really like this little speaker - I think I’ll be buying several for Christmas gifts this year.
<br>
<br>Here’s the detail on the songs I tested -and my observations. The winner is marked with a checkmark. (✔)

<br>
<br>**Long Train Running - The Doobie Brothers
<br>TB - Nice bass guitar - midrange sounds a little weird, hard to explain.

US,B0CW933QSJ,R2BOO2V8AM6G4F,Another great speaker from Tribit,,"Tribit keeps kicking out fantastic speakers and you really should give them a hard look when comparing to brands such as JBL or Bose. This one does not disappoint at all.
<br>
<br>Unlike many of the other ""vertical"" (stand-up) speakers this one has true Left and Right drivers on opposite sides so you get an actual stereo sound and image. I verified this with a L/R channel test. It also does TWS but I do not have a second speaker to test this with. I have a feeling that with two of these you could easily have a borderline hifi setup that'd rock the garage, kitchen, den, etc. I have two of the Tribit Stormbox Flows and enjoy them in TWS mode (they are mono speakers by themselves, stereo in TWS, unlike this one that is stereo by itself and in TWS).
<br>
<br>The X-bass works as I prefer as it gives deep and tuneful bass at lower listening levels (somewhat acts like an old-school loudness button). You do not need to crank it up to 75% volume to experience good bass, which is a peeve of mine with other brands.
<br>
<br>This is a huge step up from the plethora of $40 speakers that are on amazon so know that your extra $20 or so is getting you an improvement in quality and sound. And even at the current price point I'm not sure you'll find something better in this range.
<br>
<br>It also has a 3.5mm input which a lot of the big-name speakers are now missing. Kudos to Tribit for still including this.
<br>
<br>Tribit continues to impresses me with their bluetooth speakers and they have qualities that easily put them above their competition. It's built well, sounds great and has a true stereo image from a vertical speaker, which is a huge deal to me. I am rather tired of the trend of companies going mono just to eek out a few more db. If you want a party speaker for you and your closest 50 friends, buy a larger speaker. If you want good quality sound in a small vertical form-factor, buy this one.",否,5,tkm,2024-06-17
US,B0CW933QSJ,R3EL62RMBK1R9T,"Nice portable speaker, but sound could be improved",,"This has a long battery life so far. I worked in the yard all day yesterday and this was still going strong. I think I was listening to music for at least 11 hours.
<br>
<br>Connecting via bluetooth is super easy and quick. Zero issues with my Samsung phone.
<br>
<br>Sound gets pretty loud but it appears muffled to me. It's not super clear. The X-bass is nice as it gives it a little more depth. If you download the app you can adjust the equalizer. I noticed that the preset EQ settings makes the sound hollow for some reason. Not sure why that is.
<br>
<br>I like this speaker. There is not silly RGB lighting or anything like that.
<br>
<br>I DO wish they would have included some type of carrying case/bag. It would be nice to keep it protected/clean when moving it from place to place or if it's in a bag...etc.
<br>
<br>I like this but just with the sound was slightly more clear/crisp sounding.",否,4,Nigel,2024-06-17
US,B0CW933QSJ,R7NVT4GFGLJ6T,Really good speaker!,,Very nice! This speaker has really good sound. Mids and highs are really balanced. Bass is exceptional. Build quality is where Tribit shines. This speaker is built with travel in mind (made to be outdoor). Battery life is fantastic and speaker charged fast via USB-C. The Tribit App works well enough and you can tailor your sound to your liking. All in all a really nice speaker!,否,5,Denise,2024-06-16
US,B0CW933QSJ,ROY7VFNFFSMJJ,"One of the better ""small"" speakers",,"In the past four years (alone) I have handled, tested, and listened to hundreds of Bluetooth speakers. I bought a LOT of them, some over $500 each.
<br>Tribit is a name that (I think) is coming on fast and putting out some quality products that sound GOOD if not great and at reasonable cost. Great competition for the established ""big names"". Which is a good thing, everything gets better with competition.
<br>I will be reviewing this speaker *based on its size* and price range only. I practically never mention other brands but might ""hint"" at something.
<br>I listened to this speaker for almost a week (not exclusively I will admit) and I am mildly impressed. For a speaker with two drivers of only 48mm (thats only 1.88976 inch!!) this speaker has impressive sonic ability.
<br>I note that almost all ""no name"" low cost speakers like to mention ""Rich room filling bass"", ""Shocking bass"", ""massive bass"", on and on, have BASS in big letters all over their box but will usually have barely perceptible if any bass frequency output. This speaker barely mentions bass yet has more than you would expect for such small drivers. If placed in a bass trap, (I have a few in my house) you will actually be impressed by the bass output. I can actually feel a ""thump"" in the counter in certain areas. Very surprising.
<br>A couple of rooms away the bass is very noticeable.
<br>I'm still fiddling with the EQ to try and get sound that I like, and this speaker really responds.
<br>I actually immediately downloaded the Tribit ap and adjusted the EQ before I did much listening to the speaker.
<br>The ""360°"" sound is interesting. High frequency sound is very directional, and if you have one of the two drivers not pointed directly at you it is possible to hear the difference. Still, the speaker does a pretty good job if positioned correctly at directing the sound ""at you"", but I wouldn't consider it an immersive room filling experience. Frankly I don't know of any cylindrical speaker that does have a ""360°"" sound. (I know where the speaker is)
<br>The controls work very well. The speaker connects VERY QUICKLY, and stays connected.
<br>I sincerely appreciate the demure ""turn on and turn off"" sounds. A lot of low cost speakers seem determined to make the loudest most obnoxious sounds possible when turning on, off, or doing anything.
<br>I personally appreciate research and money being spent on sound output only, and no effort put into lights, which I always turn off anyway. This speaker has no silly lights, and I applaud Tribit for that.
<br>I also like the ""square"" build of the enclosure. No rolling away with this one.
<br>I never get my speakers wet, so I can't comment on that. Battery life seems good, but I rarely run a speaker too far down.
<br>Speaker is well and safely packaged. Instruction manual (piece of paper) could be better.
<br>Bottom line, I could mention a few speakers that perform slightly better, even at lower cost (hint=Boost), but I think this speaker does a fine job, especially at this size and price point.",否,5,bobwatts,2024-06-16
US,B0CW933QSJ,R3UP2HR3Y69A77,Absolutely an Amazing Portable Speaker:,,Tribit really goes above and beyond they make improvements all the time. They haven’t disappointed at all with. Stormbox 2.

US,B0CW933QSJ,R1Q2RH90VYQ5ZW,Small speaker with powerful sound,,"This speaker is amazing. The sound quality is excellent with crystal clear highs and mids and a suprising amount of bass that makes this speaker sound larger than it is. The build quality is also really good, it feels sturdy and the buttons have a nice feel to them. This speaker is small enough that it can fit easily into my backpack and I can just carry it with me everywhere I go. I can't really think of anything negative to say about it, its a reasonably priced great sounding small portable speaker.",否,5,Michael,2024-06-14
US,B0CW933QSJ,R24LA18LVZ26N5,"I like Tribit's other speakers more, but this isn't terrible. Harsh mids at upper volumes.",,"I have the Tribit Stormbox Blast, Tribit Stormbox Micro, Tribit Flow, and the Tribit Xsound Plus 2. All of them are good in their own ways or can be improved on by using the Tribit app to adjust the EQ. At low to mid levels this speaker sounds pretty good. It is a 360 degree but this was done in a weird way. Usually 360 degree speakers are mono if there are multiple drivers. This one has the drivers firing out of each side, but in stereo. So if you put this in a confined space like a corner or a small room you can get some nice stereo separation.
<br>
<br>The bad thing about this speaker is there is a peak in the mids that is very pronounced as you get up in volume levels, and I can't get it out with the EQ. It must be either the drivers or the cabinet making this strong reverb. At 3 volume steps above half that mid peak really starts to crank up, at max volume it's hard to listen too. The other Tribit speakers don't have this problem. The XSound 2 is basically the same price as this Stormbox 2, so if you want a more normal sounding speaker that's an option. It's overly bright but you can EQ how you want it to sound.
<br>
<br>The Earfun U Boom sounds a bit more balanced and a bit less boxy to me while being cheaper ($50).
<br>
<br>Btw if you want much bigger and better sound, the Tribit Stormbox Blast ($200) is my favorite sound per dollar /size speaker. It sounds incredible for how little you spend on it. It's comparable to a JBL Partybox 100, not quite as loud, bass not quite as deep, but very very close. Plus it's much smaller, waterproof (been showering with it for almost 2 years, incredible) has RGB lights, it's a beast. More bass than the Sony ULT 7 BY FAR, fraction of the price / size.",否,4,J. Victor,2024-06-14
US,B0CW933QSJ,R2WCMMV7LZAY6D,A very solid option in this cylinder sgement of BT speakers,,"The Stormbox 2 is the follow up to the popular Stormbox that came out several years ago. The SB2 now has full Tribit app support, so you can select from pre-set EQ options and also create your own EQ for the sound you like. This particular speaker has no lights.
<br>
<br>The speaker itself has a little bit of weight to it and the fabric cover on it is a little softer than the old model. Sound tends to lean a little towards the brighter sound and bass is decent, although this speaker isn't really capable of deep bass. You do get a noticeable amount of bass roll-off as you go to higher volume levels. Overall, a very solid speaker in this price and size segment.",否,4,HLA,2024-06-14
US,B0CW933QSJ,R3P3F8EDMMF2KX,"Works if my phone is less than 12"" away and pointed in just the right direction",,"I had high hopes for this speaker based on other reviews. I ordered it as an upgrade/replacement for an old portable bluetooth speaker that charges with a Micro-USB connection, which gives you an idea how old it is. It arrived almost fully charged and easily paired with my iPhone 13. But trying to play a song is impossible. It plays for about 1/4 of a second, then cuts out for at least a full second, then another fraction of a second of sound followed by more silence, and so on. 100% unlistenable. I'm pretty good at troubleshooting issues with consumer electronics, and I'm willing to give a product the benefit of the doubt, so I didn't immediately chuck it in the trash. My first attempt was to restart/re-pair everything. Restarted the phone after ""forgetting"" the device, restarted the speaker, tried everything again--same result. Did the restart thing one more time for both the phone and the speaker--no change. Next attempt was to see if something was wrong with Bluetooth in my phone, so I paired my phone to a set of headphones, and it immediately worked as it was supposed to. Next thing was to see if there's just a problem sending a signal to the speaker, so I disconnected the phone and connected my desktop computer to the speaker via Bluetooth. Surprisingly it works just fine, so there's something about the specific connection of the phone to the speaker. Trying--and failing--again to get music to play, I set the phone down right next to the speaker to look up a solution online. In a few seconds, it started playing smoothly like it should. I wondered if it was just a glitch and everything was now ok, and picked the phone back up. It immediately got choppy again, and eventually I realized it depended on how far the phone was from the speaker. Anything less than about 12"" away and it won't play. Within 12"", it will play but it depends on the orientation of the speaker. Wondering if it was an issue with my phone, I put the headphones back on and walked away from the phone. Continuous music played through the headphones as it should as I left that room, closed the door behind me, went into the next room, and closed that door.
<br>
<br>I don't understand what's going on, but I ordered this to use with my phone. It doesn't work with my phone, but other things do. It sounded pretty good for a portable speaker when my computer was connected to it, but I have computer speakers that sound way better, so that leaves me with a portable speaker I'm not able to take advantage of. Oh, and when it was connected to my computer, I noticed that the center button won't register a triple-click. I can press once to pause/play, twice to go to next track, but supposedly a triple press rewinds to the beginning of the current track. Can't get that to work either, no matter how long or short I make the clicks. So your mileage may vary, but I am decidedly unimpressed. If it happens that I have an opportunity to send this back and try a different one (perhaps I got a defective product) and my experience is better, I will certainly update this review. But for now, I tried. I really tried. Harder than most people would.",否,2,Bees M.,2024-06-14

US,B0CW933QSJ,RBSBNX8X68VHO,Really good little speaker,,"Tribit has been making really good, really solidly built speakers for a while now, and while they have branched out, designing one to suit every taste, they have kept up the quality And kept making them better. I suspect they are now one of the better know of the smaller brands. Their stormbox micro made dozens of top 10 lists, and even though I had practically their entire line I had to buy one to find out why. If you'v3e been scanning the listings for portable blue tooth speaker you have undoubtedly seen dozens of small but loud speakers. That's the speaker they are trying to catch up to... but Tribit did something pretty uniquwe with it, which nobody else has/ does. That said, from somebody who puts sound quality way above tricks like lights, flash or even size, yes, it is a very good little speaker.
<br>
<br>I finally got their marquis speaker, the stormbox, and this to is a very good little speaker, with a good price to match.Bucking a trends among companies producing audio equipment. Tribit actually provides some audio specs (ythe companies with better specs are usually the ones that do). The Stormbox2 is equipped with 2 48mm full range drivers, and 34 watts peak power,a battery rated for 24 hours of use, surround sound and a bass boost. It also has a 9 band equalizer. You get a lot for your money with Tribit, and it is a quality product, not just good for the price. The only speaker I can compare this to is the Sony XB30, no longer available, and substantially more expensive when it was. When it was released it was the only full range portable blue tooth speaker, and there still are not a lot of others. That said, this will get you better sound than quite a few expensive ""top 10"" speakers. You can use the savings to buy a Tribit Strormbox micro.. a very reasonable thing to do.",否,5,E.Swope,2024-06-12

Ill be the first to say, im glad I took this chance. This speaker is AMAZING.
<br>
<br>Audio quality from all aspects is great! Lows, mids, highs, all stand out and all are crisp and clear. XBass offers an EQ adjustment that pushes a bit more on the low end, and it does flatten out the mid and highs a bit, but not bad. There is a phone app for further EQ adjustments if thats your thing as well.

<br>Speaker is small enough to toss in your bag for any kind of travel like beach, vacations, etc. The IPX7 rating is also nice so you dont have to wory about getting it wet.

It has buttons on the back for power, bluetooth pairing, bass boost and a button to easily combine two speakers for stereo sound. The front sports big buttons for volume and to control playback and phone calls. It does put out good sound for the size and the waterproof feature means no worry about bad weather or getting splashed near the pool. The battery lasts a very long time.

US,B0CW933QSJ,R32QH0ROJFJZOC,Average sound for the size,,"I purchased two of these speakers when Tribit was offering 40% off coupons during the first week after product release. I had previously purchased two Tribit StormBox Micro 2 portable speakers and was impressed by their sound given their small size, so I had high hopes for the StormBox 2. Overall, I think the StormBox Micro 2s sound better than the StormBox 2s. The StormBox 2 (not Micro 2) has an XBass button which simply activates a preset EQ profile in the app. The app has an equalizer that enables me to get better sound out of the speaker than by using the XBass profile, and the XBass button isn't programmable, so I don't see the point of the button.
<br>
<br>Initial setup was problematic. I initially tried to pair with my phone's Bluetooth settings, but that failed. Then I used the Tribit app. The app showed 2 speakers I could pair with, one with an odd prefix to the name, and one without. I chose the speaker name without the weird prefix and successfully paired. Next, the app showed a banner that the firmware needed to be updated. I clicked the banner link and started the firmware update process. It churned for about 10 minutes and then failed. Twice. I unpaired the speaker, turned it off, then started the pairing process again. This time when the app showed a firmware update was needed, I did NOT click the banner link. Instead, I went into ""Settings"" and clicked ""Upgrade Firmware"". This time the firmware was updated in about a minute. I repeated the process on the second speaker and things were good to go. Putting the two speakers in stereo mode is a bit confusing, but the process is documented in the user manual.
<br>
<br>Given the fact that the speaker has 2 drivers, I expected better sound than the Micro 2. There is slightly more bass, but I found the StormBox 2 sound to clip at lower volumes than the Micro 2. Overall, the sound is fine for what I paid. But since you can regularly find a bundle of 2 Micro 2 speakers for 40% off, and the Micro 2s are much more portable, I'd opt for 2x Micro 2s over 2x StormBox 2s.",否,3,Terrence Fleury,2024-06-07
