US,B0D9Y7N23T,R2DBFAROC2SAC1,This is the one if you like bass,,Excellent sound for its size. Better than equivalent JBL or Sony. Highly tunable with app. You can create separate EQs for every room you use it.,是,5,Kathleen Acosta Ekins,2025-02-19
US,B0D9Y7N23T,R3G0XRNLRR1MSH,Good and loud,,"A year ago I bought the 90 watt B1 to use at work in a noisy metal shop, and it was pretty good. The B2 is much better. The 200 watts dont give you twice the db, but sound quality is greatly improved. Its worth the extra money if you want better sound (its also notably larger and heavier than the B1). Compare this to whatever JBL bluetooth speaker you can get for $300 and this one will definitely be the better value.",是,5,Chris Robinson,2025-02-05
US,B0D9Y7N23T,RHPDX3JHLJ9WJ,Impressive,,"Originally got the 1st one. Love it and this one is better. More bass, louder, better light show. Just a little better in every way. More aux connections also",是,5,brett reuvers,2025-01-29
US,B0D9Y7N23T,R39SEQEN0AQYY2,Awesome bluetooth speaker,,"I was blown away by the quality of this speaker. It rivals the sound and build quality that comes from speakers costing twice the price. I was amazed at how this brand (Tribit) was able to compete with the likes of JBL and Sony. I had never heard of Tribit products, but I'm glad I have now. I was so impressed by the products I tested (Stormbox Blast, Stormbox Blast 2, and Stormbox Pro) that I purchased the Blast 2 as my large speaker and Stormbox Pro as my compact speaker. The original Stormbox blast was also amazing, but I decided to go with it's bigger brother, the Blast 2. If you are in the market for a large bluetooth boombox speaker, I would highly recommend this product.",是,5,SystemZ,2025-01-29
US,B0D9Y7N23T,R2UOZWWMG01CJP,I Love This Speaker,,"I've been using the Tribit StormBox Blast 2 for over a month now, and it's amazing. The 200W power output, paired with an 80W subwoofer, delivers deep, powerful bass and impressive overall sound quality. The bluetooth connectivity is excellent, my phone always connects quickly without a hassle and the range is very impressive. The customizable EQ and LED lights add a fun additional level to my listening experience without having to tweak settings on my phone.
<br>
<br>This speaker excels in providing an immersive audio experience for parties, outdoor activities, or even just great cleaning music. The IP67 waterproof rating ensures it can handle splashes and rain, making it safe even if the weather is questionable or there's a pool nearby. The battery life is impressive, lasting up to 30 hours on a single charge, which means my music keeps going without frequent recharges. The option for TWS pairing allows for connecting two speakers, enhancing the overall sound coverage at larger gatherings (if you can afford it). That said, the 12-hour charging time can feel a bit long.
<br>
<br>Overall, the Tribit StormBox Blast 2 is a fantastic addition to any party or outdoor event, with its powerful sound and user-friendly features. The deep bass is one of my favorite features. This speaker really offers a superb balance between performance and functionality, though it's bulkier size and heft can be a downside if you need something more portable.
<br>
<br>Pros:
<br>- Powerful 200W output with deep bass
<br>- Seamless Bluetooth 5.4 connectivity
<br>- Long-lasting 30-hour battery life
<br>- IP67 waterproof rating
<br>- TWS pairing for enhanced sound coverage
<br>- Customizable EQ settings
<br>
<br>Cons:
<br>- Heavier and less portable
<br>- Some mid-range frequencies can be muddled
<br>- Longer 12-hour charging time
<br>- ""Dings"" when it loses each battery bar",否,5,Eve Aluate,2025-01-23
US,B0D9Y7N23T,R1MOO8HLWU9V4B,Great but the first storm box is better.,,I am a huge Tribit fan. I have seven of their speakers going from the smallest to the largest. You cannot beat the sound quality for the money. When I saw this speaker come out of course I had to have it. Now I included a picture to show I now have the first storm box blast and this one. Surprisingly the first one is better. Better sound and volume. While this speaker is still great and cannot complain if you are looking to buy just one (unlike me) I recommend the original storm box blast. When you compare both speakers the original has slight advantage in sound. When you consider price of both. The original wins hands down.,是,4,CoreAmazon Customer,2025-01-19
US,B0D9Y7N23T,RLQOQVJX950CS,Exceptional,,"Exceptional sound, monster base, extreme clarity. I’ve tried many Bluetooth stereos in this by far is the best.",是,5,ROBERT W DONNER,2025-01-07
US,B0D9Y7N23T,R1OUKSKS77ND2C,"Dissapointing sound quality, worse than the predecessor",,"Yes there is more power and more bass but the clarity is gone, not because of bad hardware but because of bad signal processing. There is just too much digital filtering such that there is no way to equalize naturally there will always be this digital filtering somewhere down the audio path that destroys the original input (most likely their DSP). For some reason they filter some hissing sounds as if the input source was a noisy cable. Cmon this is not analog TV sound, why interfere with the digital audio input?
<br>Yes it is true the sound is muddy. I am comparing against the Original Stormbox Blast, against the soundcore MotionBoom+ and the new Boom2+. In sound quality, the Blast2 are the worst of the 4.
<br>I would sort them by sound Quality as follows: MotionBoom+, Blast, Boom2+, Blast2. Yes incredible that the new iterations of both brands both of them dissapoint in sound quality, apparently thiking well, the use case for these are just parties where everyone is drinking and not being really critical of the sound, they just want some punch and go home. At least the Boom2 is equalizable to some extent, but the Blast2 is a total loss.",是,3,Miguel Rodriguez,2025-01-07

US,B0D9Y7N23T,RP0TFRMUM0O71,Great bluetooth speaker!,,Have only had speaker for over a week and I am very impressed! Great low end and plenty of volume! The lights are a great feature! Haven't tried karaoke feature yet but looking forward to. Would definitely recommend! The update makes a big difference to the overall sound in a great way! Very good value for the money!,是,5,Donnie Hall,2025-01-03
US,B0D9Y7N23T,R1GFQBCQMW1PL3,Very impressive.,,"This speaker is very impressive. The first thing that surprised me was how incredibly heavy it is. It actually weighs about 16 lbs. That may not seem like an awful lot, but trust me, compared to other speakers that were supposed to fit the bill for this size category, they're not even close to this. I have a bunch of Bluetooth speakers. I've got a couple of really big ones that stand about 36"" tall, and a bunch of small ones and a couple medium sized ones. The medium size one, which is what I would call this item is the one that I've really been searching for for a long time. All of the medium sized ones that I've acquired in the past are just light duty, lightweight, not loud items. This one, sounds great, and gets phenomenally loud for its size. This thing is the real deal. It's priced about $300, which makes it less expensive than some of the big brands, like JBL which has a speaker about the same size, but it's about $100 more expensive, and I don't know if it sounds as good as this one, or as loud. I'm really happy with this speaker. It does not have a remote control, or a need for any kind of app, which is kind of nice. It's just simple in design, and simple to operate. I definitely recommend it and give it 5 stars.",否,5,Mark of Excellence,2024-12-29
US,B0D9Y7N23T,R75CLKRV2CKX7,Amazing!,,"This speaker is amazing! The sound quality is just great, bass is GREAT! Very easy to use, and connects quick! Some people said it sounds muddy and whatnot but that's not the case with mine! And battery is amazing! It lasted me around 14 hours of non stop playback at 60-70% volume which is great for its size! And I will say it's a bit heavy, but you have to expect that from a speaker this big!",否,5,Ruslan Norovyatkin,2024-12-20
US,B0D9Y7N23T,RBGA1PX0ONEVS,WOW The quality of sound out of this is great for a portable boom box.,,"The media could not be loaded.       &nbsp;Only dislike is a little more documentation would be nice but you can figure it out if I can.
<br>Let me start by qualifying my review. I am over 60 and do not have the best hearing.
<br>The video is 4 short clips in one of my Iphone 15 recording the Tidbit playing a jazz, Rock, ALT, and folksy piece on this device using bluetooth and a 6 year old player. The music is all MP3 128 bit minimum quality. Whether I use bluetooth or the 3.5 mm aux input it all sounds good. The device is easy to bluetooth to another device. I figured there was no way it would bluetooth to my 6 year old portable player but it did. I did have a little difficulty getting the aux port to ""be used for my music input. I had to turn off the unit and then plug in my aux port to my player and start my player then turn on the Tribit and it started playing the music from the aux port input. But you have to have bluetooth off on any devices the TRibit is bluetooth connected too or it will default to bluetooth. You need to download the app to update firmware but it worked fine before and after the firmware was updated. The app lets you do all the equilizer and light tweaking and you can add your own custom equalizer profiles. I have seen some bad reviews on the sound quality on this but I think it is amazing. But I do not like the bass that moves cups across the table or extreme volume levels. This had plenty of volume power to clearly play music in a 80 x125ft shop with 18' ceilings. In the photos are some screen prints working in the APP. This charged up with the 120v wall cord in about an hour. I played it a half hour and it still showed full charge. The only inputs on the back are for a right and left microphone and the aux port. There is a usb c charging port if you dont have 120volts available. There is also a usb a to charge other devices. There is no am/fm all music has to come from an external source.",否,5,Engine Shop Joe,2024-12-19
US,B0D9Y7N23T,R1GGDHM2HDX2P0,Audiophile Superb !,,"I prefer Sound Clarity and each speaker performing its own Instrumentals and this exactly what You get ! At 60% I went straight back remembering MARANTZ I enjoyed in my teens .This are the 1RST time I matched the Speakers Sounds I enjoyed in my youth .From Marantz to Jensen Tri in my pickup playing Van Halen ! This device spot on . Out of the Box IN 3 MINUTES i was MADLY in Love ! I will order another next week .I can think of little else I would enjoy more .Running tablet to avoid Subscription on car . Carry this and tablet and save thousands on car AUDIO ! I will be toting this set up all year ! It come fully charged , no way those small batteries can Pump that much sound for DAYS but they do ! Its an AMAZING FEAT to get that sound from batteries in any way for even an hour .It defies logic .I watched 200 Videos and reviews prior to purchase .I own bose ,JBL ,EDIFIER ,ADVENT ,SANSUI ,MARANTZ and more .For what this are designed to do 10 Thumbs UP ! Best AMAZON purchase ever . Dont wait !

US,B0D9Y7N23T,R1ZZENR1XERYSC,Solid Speaker,,"The media could not be loaded.       &nbsp;I really like the sound quality out of this. I’m actually surprised by how good this sounds. The sound separation is fantastic. And for its size, It cranks out quite a bit of sound. I like that it comes with a double round plug. Those are pretty universal. So it can get sharped up. And it charges fairly quick. It also can be charged via usb c. AND it can charge my devices as well. I haven’t had any issues with this speaker at all. Build quality is great. Seems very well made. It’s really easy to get connected too. It seems a little bit on the higher end of the price scale for a speaker of its size. But honestly it sounds better than even my jbl of the same size. My only complaint is the same with all BT speakers. Please make TWS pairing universal. I’d like to hook up my other BT speakers together. I’m impressed by this thing. And I would really recommend it if you are on the market for a larger BT speaker.",否,5,Kosta Ware,2024-12-16
US,B0D9Y7N23T,R1E8YVHCKM84YS,Serious sound machine!,,"The Tribit StormBox Blast 2 is one serious (bluetooth) speaker. I am tempted to say the best bvlaster out there, and if it isn't, well, it's pretty close. The only other portable speaker which even comes close is the JBL extreme, and I would have to listen to them side by side to say which is better. At the time of this review I would give it to Tribit. They really are one of remarkably few audio companies which pays attention to sound quality. This is nearly full range sound... which you will find in very few mid-range speakers, and has the clarity, detail and accuracy typically found only in audiophile equipment, and almost never in a piece of equipment like this, on the surface, a party speaker with lights, and mic inputs (and effects) for karaoke. It also has aux in, and charge out, and is a thundering 200 watts. Thus far I have only taken it to half volume and it is louder than my 80 watt in wall speakers. Even at that volume there is no noise, no artifacts, no distortion, and there is remarkable detail which I was surprised by, have never heard in a blaster. That said, Tribit named this speaker appropriately. Is there another 200 watt bluetooth speaker you can carry? Yes, it can be carried, but I think they put this out when they did for those who want weight training ;) It is no light weight any way you look at it.
<br>
<br>The bass is substantial, even when you are not using bass boost, and it does have an extra bass button. I had this speaker sitting on a small table on an (outdoor) cement pad. You could feel the floor vibrate, and the vibrations could be felt on the wood floor in my house as well. If you are looking for powerful bass, look no further.
<br>
<br>The mids and highs are also strong. I heard details in songs I'd missed in songs I have heard dozens of times before .
<br>A tip , when looking at speakers, you'll find that very few report audio specs... because they don't want to talk about the specs if they are less than optimal. . Tribit does, and their specs hold up to comparison with some of the best blue tooth speakers out there.
<br>
<br>I have been following Tribit for years, and have nearly every speaker they have made in that time. I know that you always get more for your money with Tribit. I also know that it is a very innovative company which has hit the mark by doing things nobody else has done, and also, certainly not least of all, that they care about sound quality....and it shows in their products. This is a pretty remarkable speaker. It even impressed by husband. He's a guy who refuses to listen to blue tooth, sure that you can not get high fidelity without a cord. This stopped him in his tracks.
<br>
<br>and, since I barely mentioned it so far, at just over half volume I could hear it 500 feet away.
<br>
<br>Tribit got a lot right with this speaker.
<br>Note the controls in white, not the typical black on back, which makes them really hard to see, especially at night.
<br>It has bass boost and (2 modes of) party lights. They can both be turned off, for those who do not care for them, or who want to conserve battery.
<br>It has tws pairing, not just with this generation of their speaker, or their brand of speaker, but with any speaker that has tws. It also has 'party mode' which you can use to pair up to 100 speakers.
<br>It has both usb and ac power, a huge battery, and charge out (with a usb A port).
<br>It also has aux in and 2 mic ports with independent volume controls.
<br>and, for those who care about specs:
<br>200 watts out (on ac,) 180 watts on battery.
<br>frequency response: 40hz to 20 khz
<br>frequency range:2402-24800Mhz
<br>7992W battery.
<br>
<br>Do not let the price fool you. This speaker is definitely worth a look (and listen ) and yes, it compete with speakers costing 2 or 3x as much.",否,5,E.Swope,2024-12-15
US,B0D9Y7N23T,R2KHVU1JLVJXNX,Great sound and well build!,,"I was pleasantly surprised by how great the sound is, coming from this speaker.

It’s even better when tuned to your listening needs through the app. Best on the market for your $. Better than soundcore , jbl, bumpbox and the new earfun !

US,B0D9Y7N23T,R2UEWXX8TYSLSS,Bass bass bass! Ultimate party speaker,,"The media could not be loaded.       &nbsp;Two microphone ports for (wired ) mics for professional style weather Announcing , singing &amp; recording or using for fun for karaoke . 200w speaker with an 80w subwoofer , its weights over 14 pounds &amp; is ip67 waterproof (full waterproof &amp; dustproof) it’s got deep bass sound simple setup plug is AC , Bluetooth 5.4 for amazing connection , long battery length of 20 or more hours , use the audio es to customize your audio or the presets to switch from strong bass to more clarity and bright audio. Has a new preset called x3d which is meant to
<br>Provide audio in all directions and sounds awesome , if you don’t like bass in your Bluetooth speakers this isn’t for you. If you love bass filled sound it’s perfect for house oarts indoor or outdoor. It’s full TWS so you can listen to a 400w stereo in Left &amp; right speaker with another Blast 2 speaker or even pair it to the Blast 1 speaker instead bother see very options. The Tribit app is one of the best I’ve come across for Bluetooth speakers allowing a wide range of sound changes. But also the LED customization as well you can customize every single light to stay on , follow the best , rotate the colors. Everything . That may be this speakers coolest function (in my
<br>Opinion. )! But the microphone is truly professional and will give you extreme clarity when using it. It’s long 3 prong wired mic is truly for the best of karaoke or even Djs I think the price range for this only being 300$ when not in sale is very generous. I own 2 of these and 1 blast 1",否,5,rC,2024-12-06

US,B0D9Y7N23T,RAD0SBH53TJ2Z,Underwhelming performance,,I had done months of research for a BT speaker for work. I do security at a warehouse. I first purchased a few for around $100 and they had zero low end. So I got the Tribit Stormblast 1 and loved it but when the 2 came out I had to have it. I am very underwhelmed overall. I’d save your money and go with something else. I just purchased a Harman Kardon Go 3 to replace this one so hopefully it sounds better.,是,4,Amazon Customer,2024-11-27

US,B0D9Y7N23T,R1FRMR0UAY2ZKB,"Loud, but sub par sound quality",,"My wife was looking for a large, portable Bluetooth speaker to do events with for her dance school. Many of these events are held in retirement homes in rooms that are generally about 20'x50' with about 15-40 in the audience. So her small JBL Flip 5 wasn't really up to the task. I have a full Yamaha DXR PA system that is great, but overkill for these smaller venues. I ordered the Tribit StormBox 2 based on some reviews online saying it was a good alternative to the JBL Boombox 3. The price was about $160 less so I went for it. The Stormbox works as a loud Bluetooth speaker and would easily cover the needed area. However, when you got past 50% volume it becomes difficult to listen to. There a muffled yet grating sound to the music. It is very unbalanced sounding, a lot of mid-bass (200Hz-ish) and a lot of mids at maybe 600-800Hz. It lacks clarity, and makes music sound irritating. It may be possible to solve these issues with some EQ adjustments, but that would require an extra app that may or may not be compatible with your music app and adds another layer of complexity. We decided to order the JBL Boombox 3 to see how it did. The JBL was significantly clearer and more musical sounding. The Tribit does have slightly more bass, but sacrifices everywhere else. The Tribit isn't a terrible alternative to the JBL, and some might not notice the poor sound quality. It can produce loud music in a portable system. We ended up returning the Tribit and keeping the JBL. There isn't much to say about the JBL other than it does the job you expect it to do and it does it well. The sound is well rounded, the volume is impressive, the sound is full and clear. If you want dance party bass however, you will need to go with something that has a separate subwoofer like a PA system.",是,3,Jalalila,2024-11-13
US,B0D9Y7N23T,R118QIHEO9Q1SE,Not the best speaker,,"There was a lot of hype with the drop of this Tribit Stormbox Blast 2. It is the successor to the ever popular Storm Box Blast 1 but did not do enough to convince me.
<br>
<br>It is LOUD, but not very rich or clear. A lot of the vocals sound bad coming through the speaker, the instrumentation sounds are good but it should sound generally nice out of the box.
<br>
<br>There is an EQ setting with lots of options but no one wants to tinker with it heavily just to play certain songs.
<br>
<br>Songs with strong bass sounds good, rock/punk instrumentation doesn't sound very good.

US,B0D9Y7N23T,RKZYQTSBN1VM9,I really wanted to love this…,,"The Stormbox Blast is one of my favorite speakers and hands down the best value out there compared to similar speakers at this price point. When I heard about the SB2, I jumped on ordering one day one and eagerly awaited my SB1’s replacement. Unfortunately, that will not be the case.
<br>
<br>UPDATE: As of 11/19 there is a new firmware update (4.5) for the StormBox Blast 1 that allows stereo pairing between the 1 and 2. Works fantastic. Updating rating
<br>
<br>While the bass is HEAVY on this thing so is the weight. For there to be no strap or attachment points for a speaker of this size and weight is another miss by Tribit. But the biggest downer is the sound. It is muddy as all get out and even tweaking the EQ, the SB1 sounds better. IMO, much better.
<br>
<br>I bought it on sale and still don’t think I will be keeping this speaker. It’s fun, but impractical and if you already have a SB1, it makes more since to buy a speaker you can pair with it for massive and less money vs. big sound in one speaker. I really wanted to love this, but this feels like a step back vs forward for Tribit.
<br>
<br>UPDATE: After firmware update for the 1 that allows stereo pairing between the 1 and 2, there is a greater value prop with this speaker. Still testing EQ settings to get it dialed in and will update this review once I make final decision.",是,3,Moozicmon,2024-11-09
