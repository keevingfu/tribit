"@SigmaMastersOfMind","false",,,,,"Ugwq1w3KpkBH71ppSdR4AaABAg","Got 2 motion 300 for 60$ each. Compared to Bose Flex, they are really close, I also have the oluv's eq for them and used the flex preset. For the same money 120$ for 2x motion and 120$ for 1 flex,I would 110% go for the 2 motion 300.

2 speakers is always better than 1. Sometimes more than 2 times better.

I also have a Vifa Helsinki preset for the motion 300,but when put side by side, even with 2x motion 300 I still prefer my Vifa Helsinki,the retail price is also almost 10 times higher so not a fair comparison but threw this info in just for the sake of it.

The motion 300 is a highly customisable speaker, so you can make it sound just how you want it to.

Forgot to mention,I also compared 2x motion 300 with 1 JBL Xtreme 4, I got right when it launched,the JBL has more bass,and a fuller sound, but in term of loudness they are literally the same. I returned it since 400$ was definitely too much for it.",,"204",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"false",,,,,,,,"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDHNMQBj0nE&t=18s","4 months ago (edited)","3",,,,,"Smaller brands catching up??

JBL sounded weak (their speakers are hit and miss, pro line is great stuff, consumer line not so much)
Bose always has quality sound but at the cost/decibel per buck equation, they’re usually only moderately favored.
Tribit? Never heard of them. Sound is trebly and weak.
Marshall makes great guitar amps. I’m sure the name/logo is about all the amp company has in common with that speaker. Sounded midrange-y and lacked bass…just like their amps. 😂
Thanks for playing them all back to back to back…and back.
I’m sure it’s helped narrow down my selection.😊",,"204",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"false",,,,,,,,"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDHNMQBj0nE&t=18s","3 months ago","0",,,,,"Smaller brands catching up?? I try 9 of the BEST SMALL bluetooth speakers","comment",,"mDHNMQBj0nE",,"0"

Using the stock EQ, it tends to have a dull & muddy sound. It lacks detail & separation in the midrange.

Speaker manufacturers may want to do away with the racetrack driver & dual tweeters.

For a speaker its size it sounds really good at 50-60% volume with good bass making it ideal for indoor listening. At volumes past 60%, it gets insanely loud while maintaining clarity, making it ideal for outdoor listening.

Making it a versatile speaker for both applications, which is very rare these days.",,"204",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"false",,,,,,,,"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDHNMQBj0nE&t=18s","4 months ago","0","UgySyYIknylGyxyGzAx4AaABAg",,,,"Smaller brands catching up??

"@martinwhite3559","false",,,,,"Ugx2zf_hILzikcohvmp4AaABAg.AB6GlmPiit-ACoA--atDKb","I think for value for money the UE boom and wonderboom are amazing. They have an interesting look that you either like or don't like. JBL has the best family of portable type speakesr but UE is not too far behind. For a premium speaker, the Bose is a great option. Sonos is also pretty good but they are a (mostly home stereo and movie theatre style) super premium speaker brand. They try to deliver a more true audio sound experience. JBL is a more party vibe. Bose is also a premium brand that is somewhere in-between the other 2. Sony is great too but is it value for money? You pay a little more than JBL. Mostly for the brand name. If you are looking for value for money then JBL is the clear winner. Their whole range of speakers (not just portable) are amazing. Not quite as good as Sonos but much more affordable. I am a Sony man myself but that is a personal thing and I pay a little more for it. If Sonos was cheaper then I would recommend them everyday. I know they don't specialise in compact portable speakers but the Roam 2 is a pretty good speaker. The move 2 is the best qyality sounding portable speaker on the market but it is a bit bigger than the speakers in this video. It is more a speaker that you can move around your house and take on a weekend getaway. If premium sound quality matters. You you can afford the move 2, it is worth every cent. You pay more but you will know where that money went, unlike with Sony where you may be able to get similar for less. Like apple, Sony work on brand loyalty. I wonder if JBL will stay as adorable in the future as their popularity expands.",,"204",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"false",,,,,,,,"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDHNMQBj0nE&t=18s","2 months ago","0","Ugx2zf_hILzikcohvmp4AaABAg",,,,"Smaller brands catching up??

At least you mentioned that results vary for different songs. But it's no excuse for not sampling multiple songs from multiple genres over the course of hours and hours to give us an authentic and true sense of their capabilities. Additionally, you need to fiddle with each speaker's EQs for those that have app support. Of course you don't want to do all that, because that takes time and effort. And you'd rather take the easy route and spit out a useless video because of laziness. Harsh but true.
